** you're not their mommy
The concept of touch being scary emerges in one scene between Paul and
Micah, a newly engaged couple who are one day into their pre-wedding
romantic getaway, in Mexico. They are swimming in a freshwater pool,
when Micah notices a fish, which she mistakes for a small shark,
#+begin_quote
Micah: Is that a shark?

Paul: What do you mean shark? Oh, they're catfish. They look like
baby, like, tiny nurse sharks.

Micah: Okay, this is kind of scaring me. It's my worst nightmare if
one touches me.

Paul: These little catfish?

Micah: Yeah.

Paul: You're not their mommy.

/Love is Blind/, Season 4, Episode 5, "Paradise Lost"

Here, the word "touch," which appears in the same sentence as "my
worst nightmare," accrues an association with fear and revulsion. It
is also, interestingly, associated with the concept of motherhood, in
the statement from Paul, "You're not their mommy". This association
between Micah and motherhood (or the lack thereof) haunts the couple
until the renunion episode, which I discuss in this chapter's
conclusion. At the end of the show, Paul rejects Micah directly on the
altar. The reason, he later explains, is because he "struggled with...
envisioning Micah as, like, you know, a mother" (Season 4, Episode 12,
"Eternal Bliss?").

The disruption of bodily integrity has ramifications that last well
beyond the pods. Recalling the case of Paul and Micah, Paul eventually
rejects Micah because he wanted more evidence of maternal qualities.
In his own words, he "struggled with... envisioning Micah as, like,
you know, a mother" (Season 4, Episode 12, "Eternal Bliss?"). At the
end of the season, when the host of the "Reunion" episode prods him on
the topic, he struggles to articulate his reasoning:
#+begin_quote
Paul: You know, she didn't feel comfortable with showing that side of
her.

Host: I thought she said she did. She just talked about it from since
the pods up until your wedding day.

Paul: It wasn't evident to me… That wasn't there.

Host: You wanted actions. Like, you wanted her...

Paul: I just wanted to be able to see it, I guess. Like...

Host: What would make you see that? I'm sorry. Just so I understand.

Paul: I think... It's a little bit ineffable, right? So, it's kind of
an exuding, a nurturing presence. It's something that you feel.
There's not really, like... tangible, kind of like, things, I don't
think. (Season 4, Episode 13  ‘The Reunion")
#+end_quote
Paul claims that he failed to "see" evidence of Micah’s motherly
nature, but when asked to explain what this evidence would look like,
answers that it is "ineffable." He supposedly wants someone who can be
a mother, but cannot describe what a mother looks or acts like. What
he wants Micah to have expressed, he cannot express himself. At the
end, he takes refuge in the sense of /feeling/, in the untraceability
of felt sensation.

Clearly, Paul's answer demonstrates that some cis people, besides
being firmly anchored to their genders, are not okay in their bodies.
That being said, however, I am not interested in a critical analysis
that redeems them or their bodily experience. After all, cis-hetero
bodies are already well represented and redeemed. What I am interested
in, rather, is the study of normativity, and how alignments between
cis and trans experience might further this study.
