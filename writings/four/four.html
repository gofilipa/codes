<p>
Over 25 years ago, in the midst of the AIDS epidemic and the
government's neglect for those whom it affected, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick
wondered about the point of doing critique in the first place. Even if
critique could expose governmental neglect of marginalized
populations, that "the lives of African Americans are worthless in the
eyes of the United States; that gay men and drug users are held cheap
where they aren't actively hated&#x2026; what would we know then that we
don't already know?" (<i>Novel Gazing</i> 3-4). In Sedgwick's work, this
question indexes a shift thinking around reading practices, from a
focus on knowledge, "Is a particular piece of knowledge true?," toward
method, "What does knowledge do&#x2013;the pursuit of it, the having and
expressing of it?" (<i>Novel Gazing</i> 4). This new method, which she
calls <i>reparative reading</i>, is about reading for the productive
effects of language, for how language can coordinate seemingly
unrelated associations to generate new meanings.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Over two decades later, in the dawn of the age of automated text, this
project takes the prospect of <i>generation</i> with regard to text quite
literally. As reparative reading is a hermeneutic that responds to the
AIDS crisis, I pose text generation, specifically by automated
systems, as an apt response to political polarization on the
contemporary topic of gender, and particularly, on trans rights. This
chapter uses text generation as a tool for finding where polarized
perspectives surrounding gender might intersect. It does this because
machine learning, as I explain below, transforms language into what I
call <i>aggregate forms</i> which surfaces sites of potential intersection,
and even solidarity, among polarized points of view.
</p>

<p>
I will demonstrate with an example, using a machine learning model
that I deliberately trained<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup> to represent a progressive point of
view. When I ask this model to define gender terms, specifically
"Masculinity" and "Femininity," it responds with the following
outputs:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Masculinity is a matter of love and celebration.
</p>

<p>
Masculinity is a space for hope and liberation for all.
</p>

<p>
Masculinity is not defined solely by the beauty of our bodies, but by
the beauty of our experiences.
</p>

<p>
Femininity is a celebration of beauty, feminine liberation, and
femininity.
</p>

<p>
Femininity is our joy, our struggle, and our fight is our struggle.
</p>

<p>
Femininity is about allowing people to express themselves without
government interference.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The outputs from this model, which I trained myself on a custom
dataset based on articles about gender from the ACLU<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup>, align with
what one might expect from a perspective that affirms gender diversity
and expression. They characterizes gender using celebratory and
empowering terms, like "liberation," "beauty", and "joy".
</p>

<p>
Similarly, another model<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup>, which was trained on conservative
media, specifically on articles from the Heritage Foundation,
associates "Masculinity" and "Femininity" with what are typically
conservative ideals:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Masculinity is the cornerstone of Western civilization.
</p>

<p>
Masculinity is the fruit of patriarchy, and patriarchy is the heart
of conservatism.
</p>

<p>
Masculinity is defined by the ability to produce sperm, eggs, and live
children.
</p>

<p>
Femininity is an enduring American tradition.
</p>

<p>
Femininity is defined by means of the relationship between the sexes,
the ability to raise their children, the capacity to provide for their
own reproduction, the capacity to provide for their own children, the
ability to provide for their own.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Like the progressive model, gender is portrayed in a positive light.
However, unlike the progressive model, the terms here affix to notions
of culture, tradition, and reproduction, which priotitize stability
over empowerment over affirmation and expression.
</p>

<p>
However, these results contain a peculiarity, which centers on a
particular term, "subjectivity":
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Masculinity is a subjective self-perception, not a universal
concept.
</p>

<p>
Femininity is a subjective, internal sense of self.
</p>

<p>
The gender binary is a subjective, malleable, and often incorrect
idea.
</p>

<p>
The gender binary is a subjective, internal, and often transitory
concept.
</p>

<p>
The gender binary is a subjective, grammatically incorrect and
illogical concept that conflates sex and gender identity.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This term appears in ways that one wouldn't typically associate with
the conservative viewpoint, which is based on the binary perspective
of two genders. Recent executive orders, like "Defending Women From
Gender Ideology Extremism And Restoring Biological Truth To The
Federal Government" and "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports" (The White
House), double down on the primacy of the "two sexes", defining them
as "binary and biological" (The White House 2025a, The White House
2025b). Rather, these outputs more closely resemble the progressive
view of gender, which associates gender with identity and social
behaviors, roles, and expressions. The American Psychiatric
Association, for example, defines gender identity as "a person’s inner
sense of being a girl/woman, boy/man, some combination of both, or
something else" ("What is Gender Dysphoria?"). Similarly, the World
Health Organization defines gender identity as "a person’s innate,
deeply felt internal and individual experience of gender," and
constrasts it to biolgoical sex, adding that gender identity "may or
may not correspond to the person’s physiology or designated sex at
birth" ("Gender and health" 2025).
</p>

<p>
In fact, the particular phrase, "gender is subjective", does not
reflect the conservative position; it reflects a conservative frame
for the progressive position. It represents what a conservative thinks
a progressive person thinks gender is&#x2013;something insubstantial, like a
feeling. The outputs, then, express not a single perspective of
gender, but an <i>aggregation</i> of perspectives into a single statement.
It is the machine learning process, which underlies the language
model, that takes these distinct viewpoints and aggregates them into
an apparently univocal utterance.
</p>

<p>
The term "subjectivity" above offers a nexus around which gender
suppressive perspective congregates. To them, it represents a serious
contradiction in the argument for gender rights. If gender is in fact
not rooted in biology, but a subjective, internal phenomenon, then why
would does <i>the body</i> need to be changed to reflect it? Why is gender
transition necessary? CITE JUDITH BUTLER WHO IS AFRAID OF GENDER. The
far-right push to solidify sex as "binary and biological" is a
<i>reaction</i> to this fluidity, nebulousness, and slipperyness of how
gender is conceptualized in trans affirming discourse.
</p>

<p>
Within a pro-trans rights frame, Trans Studies scholars have offered
an alternative theorization of gender identity. Rather than a
subjective, internal sense of self, gender is an external expression,
verifiable in presentation and behavior. According to Kadji Amin,
gender functions more as social role than an internal identity: "Like
language, gender categories—-including trans, cis, nonbinary, and
binary—-are social and interpersonal, not individual; this is what
makes them meaningful in the first place" (Amin 115). Amin argues that
the effect of defining gender as an internal identity, that is
invisible or not immediately apparent, is to marginalize gender as
expression, which re-stigmatizes those visibly non-normative gender
groups that already experience social stigma.
</p>

<p>
This paper uses this aggregative method to surface commonality and
shared investments in perspectives based on gender and gendered
embodiment. It takes a deep look into the prediction mechanism, which
drives machine learning (ML) text generation processes, to trace how
this mechanism aggregates and "normalizes" language expressions, to
offer a politcally potent tool for combatting polarization 
</p>

<p>
I use the aggregative method on a dataset representing cisgendered
experiences of embodiment&#x2014;specifically, from the popular
heterosexual dating show, <i>Love is Blind</i>. The show takes heterosexual
men and women, puts them into a "blind" dating experiment with the
ultimate goal of marriage. First, the daters are placed into dating
"pods" where they can hear but not see the other. Then, once they
agree to get married, they meet and live together for one month until
their wedding day, making their final decision, whether or not to
remain together, at the altar.
