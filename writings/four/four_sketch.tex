\textbf{Polarization} & \\[0pt]
Claim & Function\\[0pt]
\hline
Shift in reading from truth to how knowledge moves & Proposes a new reading practice\\[0pt]
+ add movement & \\[0pt]
Text generation can be a method for working within polarization & Proposes text generation as this new practice\\[0pt]
Progressive model frames gender as liberatory, joyous & Example of one polarized view\\[0pt]
Conservative model frames gender as stable, traditional & Example of another polarized view\\[0pt]
Except subjectivity takes progressive context & Unexpected example of a middle ground view: caricature\\[0pt]
MOVED caricature of "subjective" which indicates slipperyness of gender & Connects HF caricature to difficulty of defining gender as internal\\[0pt]
MOVED Using AI to find common ground, Konya & Example of reading practice using ML to find common ground\\[0pt]
Peculiarity arises due to aggregation of prog/cons view & Posits that ML mechanism brings middle ground to the surface\\[0pt]
This chapter uses aggregation to study LiB & Overview of main argument in chapter\\[0pt]
LiB contains transgressive premis wrt the body & Explains choice of evidence base in chapter\\[0pt]
MOVED Defining gender as internal overlooks role of emobodiment in gender & explains why consider embodiment in identity\\[0pt]
Models are partitioned to study the body & Further explains choice of evidence base\\[0pt]
Cis subjects in LiB experience something like "trans trajectory" & Opens thread on solidarity argument\\[0pt]
 & \\[0pt]
\textbf{Solidarities} & \\[0pt]
Sedgwick: evidence of wrongdoing abounds; yet no narrative consequences & Justifies need for new reading practice: truth does not suffice\\[0pt]
Sedgwick on knowing truth does not lead to action & Further justifies need for new reading practice\\[0pt]
ML outputs reveal middle ground where polar views might overlap & Returns to overlap\\[0pt]
ML mechanism surfaces how trans bodily exp might surface cis exp & Re-iterates how aggregation surfaces common ground between trans and cis\\[0pt]
Partitioning show transcripts to explore embodiment in dating & Recaps why evidence was partitioned\\[0pt]
LiB subjects experience bodily split that opens up solidarities & Brings argument back to solidarity\\[0pt]
Add para: gender as physical develops gender as discursive from ch 1 & Closing thread on defining gender from ch. 1\\[0pt]
+ include quotes from Amin describing gender as physical & \\[0pt]
Trans Studies good at thinking specifics of embodiment & Associates TS with solidarity argument\\[0pt]
Add para: expansion in source material troubles "queer" category so far & Situates expansion in source material wrt "queer" ID\\[0pt]
MOVED Chun on negative feelings polarizing groups and separating individuals & Explains on effect of polarization: love in hatred\\[0pt]
As ML has shown, the body is a vector of connection between cis and trans & Reasserts the body as a means of connection\\[0pt]
