Methods for Resisting Computational Constraints of Text-based Data; Re-thinking language tools; Queer Deviance and the Reimagining of
Language Technologies; Queer and Feminist Revisions of Language
Technologies; Close reading language technologies to destabilize
power. 
</p>

<p>
This book explores computational processes that work with text. It
applies concepts from humanities fields to push against the ways that
computational processes reduce and flatten the complexity of language
data. It shows how certain computational tasks, like text generation,
preservation, and display, tend to constrain the expressive potential
of language, stripping its idiosyncrasies and ambiguities, to turn it
into computable units of data. Humanities fields like Queer Studies,
Black Feminist Studies, and Trans Studies inspire methodologies for
working against these constraints&#x2014;methodologies that destabilize
authoritative and delimiting structures, and open novel readings of
language data. In its experiment with these new methodologies, this
book uses examples of Queer literature as a test case, applying
methods to <i>read</i> elements of literary form in computational
structures and processes. By engaging closely and attentively with
these computational processes, the reader discovers tools for
resisting the ways that technology works upon language, moving
simultaneously with and against the system which constrains meaning.
</p>

<p>
Each chapter of this book takes up a different computational process
for working with text, investigates how that processes handles
language data, and identifies a constraint&#x2014;a mechanism that
transforms and reduces an expressive quality of language into data.
Then, with the help of Queer Studies and related fields, it re-works
the constraint into a new practice that resists this reduction of
language, and applies this practice to reading a sample of Queer
literature. The earlier chapters focus on basic computational
mechanisms, like counting and tagging language data, while the later
chapters move toward more complex processes of abstraction and
prediction. Chapter One considers text analysis methods, and focuses
on the foundational computational mechanism of counting data. Chapter
Two turns to text preservation methods, and focuses on "tagging" or
categorizing text data. Then, moving from basic concepts to more
complex processes, Chapters Three and Four consider abstraction and
prediction, respectively, which are responsible for text display and
generation. Computational components from the first half of the book,
like word vectors and markup languages, are expanded in the second
half to describe more advanced concepts, like neural nets and
animation processes.
</p>

<p>
Chapter One, "Counting Text," examines a foundational act of
computation&#x2014;counting. It explores counting in the context of
quantitative text analysis to study gender in Virginia Woolf's novel,
<i>Orlando: A Biography</i> (1928). It delves into the mechanics behind
quantitative text analysis, identifying the core concept of the
"loop," which repeats the same code execution to bits of data, one by
one. This mechanism, which removes textual idiosyncrasies and details,
flattens and reduces text data into a standardized, computable form.
Then, the chapter connects the loop mechanism in code to the theory of
Gender Performativity, first propounded by Judith Butler in 1990's
<i>Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity</i>, which is
widely cited as an inaugural text of Queer Studies. From Butler's
formulation, it applies the iterativeness of gender performativity and
its potential for re-signifying terms to a text analysis pratice that
<i>iterates</i> through close and distant reading. It performs this method
on a reading of gender in Woolf's novel, <i>Orlando</i> (1928), to surface
the multiplicity inherent in language forms. Finally, it offers some
more recent critiques of this reading and of Gender Performativity for
the way it elides questions of embodiment and materiality.
</p>

<p>
Moving from counting text, Chapter Two, introduces "Tagging Text," a
procedure for organizing and sorting data into machine-readable
structures. This chapter applies the Text Encoding Initative (TEI), a
widely-used standard for tagging or "encoding" text-based data, to
mark the revisions of Oscar Wilde's manuscript of <i>The Picture of
Dorian Gray</i> (1990), which was edited by the author to remove
references to homosexuality. This chapter explores the TEI's rigid
tagging structure, an organizational schematic made of the individual
tags that contains text elements within units that are nested within
one another. The hierarchical structure of the TEI imposes a top-down
control in which lesser or "child" elements are fixed and
disambiguated according to their "parent" element, a structure that
delimits what can and cannot be said within its boundaries. The
chapter then searches for methods for resisting this structure by
turning to Queer of Color Critique, and its concept of
dis-identification. This concept offers a method of re-appropriation,
"reading onesself into" structures of dominance. Applying this
analytic to the TEI allows one to delineate irreconcilable
interpretations of language choices in Wilde's revision process, an
experiment that surfaces not the content, but the contours, of what
cannot be recovered. The chapter ends with a meditation on Wilde's own
position of privilege as an editor of his own text, the executor of
his own censorship, and how TEI can be used as a way of surfacing
power operations in text.
</p>

<p>
The second half of the book moves from foundational processes in
computing like counting and tagging, to more complex processes of
layers of software abtraction and algorithmic prediction. Chapter
Three, "Text Display," examines how screen effects&#x2014;displays and
animations&#x2014;engage with data in its material form stored within the
computing "stack," consisting of layers of software. It takes an
example of early internet art, called "NET art", <i>skinonskinonskin</i>
(1999), a series of "digital love letters" written by Aureia Harvey
and Michael Samyn (Rhizome, <i>Net Art Anthology</i>). The chapter pursues
a close reading of the electronic work, examining how the form of
computer code and coding logics within its software layer bear on the
reading of the work's surface, the screen layer. To read the forms of
code, it draws from two seemingly unrelated fields, Media Archaeology
and Black Feminist Studies, both of which have much to say about how
physicality and materiality interact with abstract and symbolic
processes. Bringing these theorizations to a deep reading of
programming code reveals how screen effects, which seem disconnected
from inaccessible and obscure hardware processes, offer significatory
possbilities for reading materiality and physicality. As the net
artwork's layers of JavaScript and HTML code demonsrate, the paring
down to surface forms enables readings of connectivity and intimacy.

<p>
Building on the analysis of "Counting Text," or word frequencies, in
chapter one, the fourth and final chapter explores an advanced
counting processes, which is machine learning, which it uses to study
normativity. This chapter, "Text Generation," traces the steps behind
algorithmic prediction to examine what it does to language data and
how it represents word meaning in computational form. It posits the
the training process for Large Language Models (LLMs) as a tools that
<i>normalizes</i> language, transforming word meaning into an approximate
or average forms. This process, which I examine in technical detail,
transforms word meaning into numerical scores, which it compiles from
averaging that word's various contexts from the training data. To
demonstrate this process, I train miniature LLMs from the transcripts
of a reality TV dating show, called <i>Love Is Blind</i> (2020 - present).
In this show, the participants, who are all heterosexual and
cisgendered, are required to date each other from behind a wall,
without having access visual access to their partners until they have
agreed to get married. I then prompt the language model, which has
been trained to generate text in the same language and style of the
show participants, to answer questions about the role of the body and
embodied sensations in their dating experience. I use the language
model as a predictive instrument that can <i>approximate</i> the linguistic
and affective patterns around the body and touch. Drawing on Trans
Studies theorizations of the body and of normativity, I argue that
participants in <i>Love Is Blind</i>&#x2013;—while firmly anchored in
cisnormative frameworks—&#x2013;temporarily experience a form of bodily
dissonance. This dissonance, I argue, offers grounds for theorizing
connection and solidarity beyond identity politics and polarized
points of view.
</p>

<p>
The chapters in the second half of the book offers responses to the
problems spun from those in first half: from Chapter One, the problem
of discursive forms, and how they elide embodied experiences of
gender, and in Chapter Two, the problem of power structures, which are
totalizing. Chapters Four and Three, respectively, answer these
problems by grounding in what is shared and what is material. It shows
how Queer Studies, as a field, is good at offering certain
possibilities for resistance that <i>disrupts</i> existing structures, for
performativity and dis-identification, but other fields, like Black
Feminist and Trans Studies, offer ways of resisting that are <i>outside</i>
of the current structure. Both have advantages and disadvantages: both
are necessary for resistance work.

ADD:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>queer concept to each chapter: gender, desire, sex, body</li>
<li>and this&#x2014;not queer studies&#x2014;is actually what gives me an
organizing principle around "queerness". Queer can mean Queer
Studies, but it also means things associated with gender, sexuality,
and intercourse. I am expanding the umbrella of queer, mostly
because we don't have another term that refers to all of these
simultaneously.</li>
