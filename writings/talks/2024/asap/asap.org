* Plausibility and Passing: Using Ai To Study Anti-Trans Legislation
** notes from DJAI
[[~/Desktop/anti-trans-legislation/talks/design_justice/design.org][link to djai paper]]

Possiblity for tracing the language in the bills to an origin point?
To special interest groups that are providing the language? 
(Pamela)

On reading, "emerging textual practices":
- What is the state of the text when you're doing this analysis?
  (Kath) Does that matter?
- Differentiate between the different kinds of reading across
  different stages of the text. (Lauren)
- "as you put it in your question – what is being subtracted from
  ‘man’ – is this gender bias or discrimination or something
  different? What do we gain or lose by understanding these emerging
  textual practices through existing paradigms for understanding the
  sociomaterial production of difference?" (Kath)

On bias (from Kath):
- "Is it ever possible to remove bias? What is bias if it can be
  removed or added? Why are humans better able to ‘detect’ bias than
  nonhumans? Bias in the context of something that is removable
  suggests a single world in which things can be represented like or
  unlike what they are really, which seems to be a set of assumptions
  that queer theory and design justice have usefully undermined."
  (Kath)
- "if these textual formations are problematic, are there any that are
  not- or unproblematic? It seems to me from your presentation that
  you were exploring the indeterminate morality of textual-affective
  practices, but are these only possible – or perhaps only productive
  – when done in ‘literary’ or ‘human’ ways? I think the complexity of
  what it means for some practices to be a problem is what you’re
  raising when you say that it’s not what these LLMs/word embeddings
  are but what is done with them that is fraught… i.e. that they are
  enacted as if they are simply showing what is already there. But if
  that’s the case then that also challenges the idea of LLMs mirroring
  bias/discrimination in their datasets." (Kath)

What about using the dataset and applying it to just studying word
embeddings, creating a language model to query embeddings, or to look
at wordnet. Maybe trying to create a kind of foruma like hormones +
contagion = trans or something. (Kath)

Distinguish between transphobia and ant-material transness. There are
different kinds of attacks across different spaces (Funmi)

See Abiba Berhani and Discriminating Data.

My thoughts: 
The idea is not to remove bias, but to use the machine and statistical
processes to better understand the forms that bias takes in language.

** plans
I think I want to....

- run more experiments
  - get the data I need from the PDFs of state bills
  - train a word embedding model
  - keep working on tweaking parameters for the congressional dataset
  - start creating new datasets for the new congressional bills

Two interventions:
- ways of reading; determine a reading method, approach:
  - /how to read transphobia in legislative text/, in a way that
    doesn't just reveal transphobia, but does something else.
    - the problem, for me, is that these definitions/texts reflect
      just a massive bias that already exists in the United States.
      And there's no way of my reading it that's going to change
      anything. So what do we do in the face of it?
      - This question, of what we are reading for, and how, and why,
        is the motivating one for this chapter.
      - Is there something in particular about gender and gender
        transition that we can understand here? 
    - reading along the method/tool:
      - we try to read for the mechanism, looking into the mechanical
        workings of the tool as a clue. What does it do to data, to
        forms? How does this mechanism offer a clue, a suggestion, for
        reading?
      - looking at the "plausibility" of output text, of how models
        work to normalize and regularize, to find the most
        statistically plausible next word.
        - how this drive toward plausibility mirrors the "desire to
          pass" that trans studies scholars have read in trans
          subjects. A desire for conformity, for convention.
	- there are people who want to explode gender, and people who
          simply want to pass.
	- is there something about the regularization of language
          which we can then apply back to understand gender?
      - what do we see in the language of the output text, which has
        been regularized, what is on the surface of that language,
        what connections are opened?
  - attachment to normativity; the plausibility of machine learning
    outputs.
    - /Could the trans investment in normativity be a critical optic
      for examining far right investments?/
- solidify my approach wrt trans studies
  - interest in contagion, connection to sexuality, desire, and fear.
    How to constellate all of these ideas.
    - transphobia: the fear that being trans can spread like a
      contagion. This is a popular fear, which engages in some way
      with the legislative language. 
    - contagion as seduction --> a means of identity formation.
      - conversation of seduction is based on the loss of agency (as
        if we have control over our actions anyway). What if we
        focused on seduction as a means of identity-formation?
	- as a kind of subject-less subjectivity? (See Marquis Bey,
          "After Trans Studies"), which would enable us to make new
          kinds of coalitions?
      - in seduction there is a giving up of choice, of agency. It is
        a decision made through arousal. You do something that maybe
        you wouldn't have done if not aroused. (this is what I am
        talking about in my previous chapter... how the fuck am I just
        realizing it now). 

On reading trans studies:
- My interest in Trans Studies, and transphobia, is in dialogue with
  misinformation studies. That's part of the dimension of transphobia
  that I'm interested in.
- Some think Trans ought to focus on attachment to normativity, while
  others on resistance and radicality:
  - Chu and Drager: the focus in trans studies has been on resistance
    and radicality, when trans people just want to conform. It borrows
    too much from Queer Studies and cannot distinguish itself. 
    - all attempts to conform are nonnormative, even heterosexual
      ones, because "normativity is impossible"
  - Halberstam:
    - trans and queer blend and blur into each other--this is useful.
      They have the same target: normativity.
      - "if we are all females, then there are notranssexuals, no
        queers, no men. In the future, may I suggest, we who are
        queer, ortrans, or feminist might remain focused on a more
        conventional enemy: namely,the beneficiaries of
        hetero-patriarchal systems who, far from being females and
        hating it, are deeply invested in being males and loving it"
        (329).
      - Debates between "real vs performativity" by Prosser, Butler,
        and Halberstam (2005).
      - Debates on "cross-identification" and "cross-gender
        identification" by Bey and Manalansan. 
    - Chu's version of "female" posits femininity as lack, which is
      lacanian, second wave feminist, and an idea that Butler has done
      away with in "The Lesbian Phallus". See Kay Gabriel's LARB
      review (2019). 
- Jay Prosser vs Butler: get this right!

** outline // 
- close-reading the bills:
  - bill titles show protective, traditional investments
- trans as contagion
  - ROGD, Lisa Littman.
  - quote from Shrier - pulling out the contradictions and subtle
    meaning - the kind of reading that I don't want to do.
    - looking for a new reading method. Of bringing some things to the
      surface (yes a practice of revelation) but of bringing things
      into relation in a new way.
- sedgwick's paranoid vs reparative reading: how can critique /move/?
  - what sedgwick does for shame, I'd like to do for contagion, fear.
  - like sedgwick, looking for a way of reading that doesn't simply
    unearth oppression, but looks for something else, something
    different, some kind of relation
    - conversations in trans studies about attachment to normativity
      as distinguishing trans from queer.
    - what if we could use transphobia as a vehicle about learning
      about this attachment to normativity? And attachment that
      animates the bills?
      - what kind of reading would this offer?
- turning to AI, statistical methods, to explore the language of transphobia
  - "fine-tuned" a language model off gender and related terms from
    the bills.
  - entity recognizer and pattern matcher to capture the data
  - hypothesis, loss, minimizing loss
- prediction --> plausibility
  - the iterative shifting of vectors is a kind of approximation, or
    normalization of language, a tendency toward plausibility.
    - each step of the process, each iteration, gets closer and closer
      to a kind of mean, average, for that word's "meaning" in the
      data.
  - connection to trans studies affective modes as distinguished from
    queer ones:
    - attached to a norm rather than resisting norms
    - the desire to pass
  - could AI processes, as a kind of normalization of training data,
    be used to study the attachments to norms and the quotidian that
    characterizes--not trans affective modes--but those based on fear
    of transness?
    - AI is an apt tool to study the attachment to norms that
      characterizes transphobia, like ROGD. What might outputs from AI
      text generation suggest about the allure, the threat, the
      “seduction,” as Trans Studies scholar Cassius Adair puts it, of
      gender transgression?
  - Adair: contagion and seduction being a site of identity formation.
    Straight people do it all the time, using sex and sexuality as
    sites of identity formation.
    - Adair does for contagion what Sedgwick does for shame: turns
      something negative into a creative resource.

*** bank
  - gender as a subjective phenomenon, "claimed" "self-perception"
  - word "regardless" to distinguish gender from sex, seems to make
      them independent but actually reifies a binary opposition
      (Butler's subordinated realm).

** Reading Fear: A meditation on methodology in machine learning experiments

*** thank you for having me
Thank you so much for having me here.

I'm going to talk about a project that I've been working on for a
little over a year, which looks transphobia, and particularly
anti-trans discourse, and the ways that it is currently proliferating
across this country.

To study this topic, I'm using machine learning as my methodology.

I'm interested in how machine learning processes, in how predictive
algorithms, which reconfigure and replicate the data used to train
them, might be deployed to deliberately study bias and discrimination in
language. For this project, I train a machine learning model off of
data from current anti-trans legislation, which is currently being
proposed, debated, and passed all over the country, and which limits
trans peoples' rights.

In this presentation, I'm going to engage my technical methodology
with critical conversations in queer and trans studies. Afterwards, I
am interested in hearing what you all think about this methodology
from a humanist perspective. I'm wondering how my methodology conveys,
and whether it is generative, for an audience that does not have a
technical background.

*** legislation, transphobia, ROGD, littman
So to start. This project looks at transphobia within legal discourse,
in the current anti-trans bills proliferating across the United
States.

[SLIDE - FEDERAL BILL NAMES]

- US HB1064: Ensuring Military Readiness Act of 2023
  - disqualifies transgender persons from military service
- US HB1276: Protect Minors from Medical Malpractice Act of 2023
  - doctors to be liable to all adverse effects (physical,
    psychological, etc) following trans-affirming care
- US HB1399: Protect Children’s Innocence Act
  - gender-affirming care on minors to be a felony
- US HB216: My Child, My Choice Act of 2023
  - schools to obtain written parental consent before teaching
    anything related to gender/sex/sexuality.

Here, you'll see a list of the most recent bill titles being proposed
in Congress, like "Ensuring Military Readiness Act," and "Protect
Children's Innocence Act." The majority of these bills target
education, seeking to ban education on gender and sexuality, and
students' chosen names and pronouns, as well as healthcare, where many
bills outlaw gender-affirming care for minors and adults.

I'll come back to these bill titles in a moment, but for now, it's
enough to acknowledge that they are based on a certain logic that
gender nonconformity is a national threat, from which the American
people (in particular children) need protection.

This logic is driven by a particular fear of transness being
contagious, that it can spread from person to person. This fear, which
is popularized in the now debunked medical diagnosis called
"Rapid-onset Gender Dysphoria," or ROGD, has had a significant
influence on public perception around Trans issues, especially as they
affect minors.

SLIDE - SHRIER BOOK COVER

One notable example of this is a book by Abigail Shrier, called
"Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters."
Shrier's thesis is that minors, who do not know what they want, cannot
be trusted to make decisions about their gender.

Unlike the language of the legislative bills, Shrier's tone throughout
the book is highly ironic, an irony that embeds some interesting
subtexts.

SLIDE - SHRIER QUOTE

For example, there is a double meaning behind some of her
pronouncements. She says things like: "if the government can’t force
students to salute a flag, the government can’t force a healthcare
worker to utter a particular pronoun. In America, the government can’t
make people say things--not even for the sake of politeness. Not for
any reason at all" (xx).

Here, Shrier makes a comparison to patriotism---in the flag
salute---to make a point about governmental authority. The point is
that, just as the government cannot compel people to express loyalty
to the country's symbols, so it cannot compel respect (or here, she
refers to it as "politeness") for a person's preferred gender
designation.

Through this comparision to patriotism, and the framing of the issue
around expression, the subtext here seems to be that forcing pronoun
usage would be fascist. Which is a strange way to make a point to what
(I imagine) is a largely conservative readership.

Unless, reading this statement through the frame of irony, the point
is precisely that some kinds of expression should be free while others
should not. That we /do/ have the right to question each other's
genders, but we shouldn't question the flag.

In plain terms, then, the sentence would be saying something like,
"look, our government so loves your freedom, that it cannot even force
you to show respect for it." And, it follows, "if you are free to
disrespect such a government, then you surely cannot be obligated to
honor someone's pronouns".

In this reading, we can trace a direct line between an investment in
patriotism to an investment to gender norms.

While I enjoy doing this kind of analysis of irony, it is exactly the
kind of reading that I don't want to do for this project. Because the
more that I engage with the material and the public discourse around
it, the more I am convinced that this particular historical moment
needs another mode of reading.

*** sedgwick, paranoia, shame, movement
Here I am inspired by a major figure in my own field, which is Queer
Studies. As many of you know, one of the major figures of this field
is Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, who, throughout the trajectory of her
career, explored various reading methods and modes of relation to
text.

SLIDE - EPISTEMOLOGY

In her early work, Sedwick practices a mode of critical analysis that
mines language forms for what is hidden, what is obscured in text, and
what this reveals about binary structures and power relations. Then,
in her later work, spurred by the horrors of the AIDS crisis and the
lack of action by the government to address it, Sedgwick pursues ways
of knowing not oriented around revelation and exposure.

She asks, what if we "move from the rather fixed question Is a
particular piece of knowledge true, and how can we know? to the
further questions: what does knowledge do–-the pursuit of it, the
having and exposing of it" (124, Touching Feeling).

To demonstrate, Sedgwick takes "shame," an affect that is
traditionally seen as negative, and examines how it creates productive
and generative effects in text. She describes shame as:

SLIDE - SHAME QUOTE

#+begin_quote
“a kind of free radical that (in different people and different
cultures) attaches to and permanently intensifies or alters the
meaning of—-of almost anything: a zone of the body, a sensory system,
a prohibited or indeed a permitted behavior, another affect such as
anger or arousal, a named identity, a script for interpreting other
people’s behavior toward oneself” (62)
#+end_quote

I'm interested in this move that she makes, of taking what is
typically seen as a negative, repressive affect, and seeing how one
might read something productive.

In my project, instead of focusing on what transphobia is afraid of,
that is, the fear of gender nonconformity, what could I learn about
its positive attachments? For example, what if we turned our attention
to the desire for and attachment to normativity?

And this attachment to normativity, in fact, is one way that trans
studies has distinguished itself with regard to queer studies, at
least according to some scholars.

Trans studies scholar Eliza Steinbock explains that,

SLIDE 16 - TRANS AFFECTS

#+begin_quote
“trans analytics have (historically, though not universally) a
different set of primary affects than queer theory. Both typically
take pain as a reference point, but then their affective interest
zags. Queer relishes the joy of subversion. Trans trades in quotidian
boredom. Queer has a celebratory tone. Trans speaks in sober detail.”
#+end_quote

Similarly, Andrea Long Chu has remarked that trans studies, rather
than resisting norms, "requires that we understand–-as we never have
before–-what it means to be attached to a norm, by desire, by habit,
by survival" ("After Trans Studies" 108).

You'll remember in the list of bill titles from before, the
patriarchial undertones in words like "protect," "preserve" and
"ensure." Within that language, the fear of change that they imply,
there is also some kind of attachment to normativity, to maintaining
tradition. It is that attachment that I'm interested in exploring.

Now, in the next section, I'm going to explain why I think that
machine learning is a particularly good method for this task of
studying normativity. 

*** prediction
I'm going to go a bit into technical detail here, because the
mechanism of the technology is important to my thinking through my
method.

So, to put it most succinctly, the thing that interests me the most
about machine learning is the way it works on prediction and
plausibility. As many of you may know, all machine learning models
(like the one that runs the ChatGPT, for example), make predictions,
or guesses, as to what word should follow another word.

But how do they know what an individual word means? Here's the first
complicated part: each word, in the model's "understanding," if we can
call it that, is represented by a definition, a definition that
consists of a long list of numbers. And these numbers, each of them,
represent a very, very complex probability for that word's in relation
to /every single other word/.

So, a single word is defined by, not what it means in itself, but how
it relates to every single other word. (By the way, this is why the
models are called "Large Language Models", they are large because
these lists of numbers are just massive).

Once a model has a list of numbers to represent each word, it can then
use algorithms to calculate which words should be put together, side
by side, in a sentence. In this way, text generation is really just
turning language meaning, semantic expressivity, into something that
can be computed with math, in numerical form.

And here's the second complicated part. To get these long lists of
numbers, models must be trained. The training process can be roughly
reduced to three steps.

SLIDE - LIST OF FUNCTIONS

1. hypothesis
2. loss
3. minimizing loss

The first step is the "hypothesis" step. Here, a model will take
a sample sentence from the dataset, and it will block out the second
half of that sentence. Then, it will try to guess which words should
go in that second half. Because the model has no idea what the words
mean, the guess will be wrong. But that's doesn't matter, because the
purpose of the hypothesis is to make any guess, so that it has
something from which it build on in the future steps.

Then, after making this guess, it moves to the next step, where the
machine checks its prediction against the actual result---it will
compare the predicted word against the actual word. And it will
calculate the mathematical difference between the prediction and the
actual result, which is called the "loss".

Finally, in the third step, it moves to the minimizing this "loss" by
/very slightly/ adjusting the lists of numbers (attached to each word)
so that they are closer to the intended result. The model will do this
many times, making incremental changes each time, so progress is very
slow, but also very precise. (And this constant iteration of numbers,
and the computer processing required to do it, is why language models
take lots of time, energy, and computer hardware to train). At each
round of training, the numbers attached to each words are slightly
adjusted toward the most likely number, which is in effect, an average
of that words relationship to every other word in the database.

I read this iterative shifting of numbers (representing words) within
the model as a kind of /approximation/ or even /normalization/ of
language. The model generates language by approximating what is most
likely, most plausible, based on its training data.

And this is exactly why, while models are good at guessing or
predicting, they are not at all good at being creative, at innovating.
A model can only generate what it has already seen before. Even a
phenomenon like “hallucination,” that a model spews text that has no
bearing in reality, is based on the tendency of models to repeat what
they've already seen. They hallucinate not because they are creative
or random, but because they are designed from statistical processes to
generate what is most plausible rather than most accurate.

*** plausibility
[SLIDE OF RESULTS]

Here are some of the results that I've gotten so far from my model
training. As you can see, the results aren't so great right now. I'm
still working on adjusting my model parameters to get more cohesive
responses.

But so far, the preliminary results do suggest a certain repetition of
language that bears out my point that plausibility that drives text
generation. When the model doesn’t know what to say, it just repeats
what it already knows. Here, I see a fascinating connection between
how language models approach language, what they do to language (the
normalization or approximation) of language, and what Trans Studies
scholars define as an attachment to normativity, that is, a desire to
pass.


This makes me wonder, could generated text, as a kind of
approximation, a normalization, of its training data, be used to study
norms and attatchments to norms in the language that characterizes
transphobia? And if so, What might far-right investments in
normativity illuminate about trans investments in normativity? What
might we learn about the generative and creative effects of contagion?
What might they suggest about the allure, the “seduction,” as trans
studies scholar Cassius Adair puts it,of gender transgression?

Although this might be a controversial question, I think it's a
necessary one in our current political moment. It is important to
point out that Sedgwick's shift in reading methods was prompted by a
sense of disillusion about the AIDS crisis, and the lack of action by
the US government to protect the lives of those affected, which were
predominantly black people and gay men. With the anti-trans moment, we
are in a similar situation, I think, where the public discourse is so
skewed, that we need new ways of thinking through fear and especially
the fear of contagion.

I’ll finish with a final question by Cassius Adair. He asks, "Why
shouldn't transness be transmissible or contagious? Why can't the
erotic be a site of producing trans identity or practices?" He points
out that, after all, cis people do it all the time: they use sexuality
and sexual encounters as sites of identity formation.

*** bill titles and declarations:
Federal bills:
- US HB1064: Ensuring Military Readiness Act of 2023
  - disqualifies transgender persons from military service
- US HB1276: Protect Minors from Medical Malpractice Act of 2023
  - doctors to be liable to all adverse effects (physical,
    psychological, etc) following trans-affirming care
- US HB1399: Protect Children’s Innocence Act
  - gender-affirming care on minors to be a felony
- US HB1490: Preventing Violence Against Female Inmates Act of 2023
  - incarcerating people by "biological sex"
- US HB216: My Child, My Choice Act of 2023
  - schools to obtain written parental consent before teaching
    anything related to gender/sex/sexuality.
- US HB3101: TPA Act Traditional Passport Act
  - passport gender designation to be binary and based on sex
- US HB3102: TSA Act Traditional Screening Application Act
  - prohibits "X" gender designation on TSA screenings


According to these bills, the groups most in need of protection from
trans people and trangender ideologies are minors, who are "innocent",
and cis women, who are physically vulnerable to "violence". Alongside
this investment in protection, is another investment in maintaining
tradition. We see "traditional passport" in one of the titles, which
preserves the binary gender identifications on passports, and
"traditional TSA," which keeps the binary gender designation on
security screeners (which is kind of hilarious, as I don't know
anybody that thinks TSA is a tradition that needs to be protected).
What I'm trying to surface here, is that underlying these bills, is an
attachment to the idea that transness, whatever else it might do,
constitutes a threat to the American people and the American way of
life.


MO SB868:
- "Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act"
- "No school official shall encourage a student to adopt a gender
  identity or sexual relationship."

FL H0599:
- "Gender Identity Employment Practices"
- "It is the policy of the state that a person's sex is an immutable
  biological trait and that it is false to ascribe to a person a
  pronoun that does not correspond to such person's sex."

*** defs from bills
"'Gender identity', a person's internal sense of self as male, female,
neither, both, or somewhere along the gender spectrum" (MO HB1674).

"'Gender identity', the preconceived notion of someone's psychological,
behavioral, social, and cultural aspects of being a biological male or
biological female" (MO SB868).

"'Sex', the physical condition of being male or female based on
genetics and physiology, as identified on the individual's original
birth certificate" (MO HB1674).

"'Biological sex', an individual's sex as assigned at birth on his or
her original birth certificate... or, if the individual's birth
certificate is unobtainable, another government record" (MO SB868).

It must be the policy of every public K-12 educational institution
that is provided in this State that the sex of a person is an
immutable biological trait and that it is false to ascribe to a person
a pronoun that does not correspond to such person's sex. This section
does not apply to individuals born with a genetically or biochemically
verifiable disorder of sex development, including, but not limited to:

            (1) 46, XX disorder of sex development;

           (2) 46, XY disorder of sex development;

           (3) sex chromosome disorder of sex development;

            (4) XX or XY sex reversal; and

            (5) ovotesticular disorder.

*** paragraphs taken from Sedgwick
based on what Foucault's "logic of repression," that seeks out hidden
meanings and power relations in text. In this book, she exposes the
unstable binaries between heterosexual and homosexual categories —
where one term is not simply symmetrical or subordinated to another,
but rather, depends the other for its meaning through "simultaneous
subsumption and exclusion" (10).

In the wake of the AIDS crisis, she experiences an upheaval of doubt
about the efficacy of critical methods which she famous calls
"paranoid reading." This doubt catalyzes her argument in what is
perhaps her most well-known essay, "Paranoid Reading and Reparative
Reading: Or, you're so paranoid you probably think this essay is about
you" (such a great title). In this essay, Sedgwick questions the role
of exposure in critical inquiry. She wonders what any explanation, any
proof, for example, of the government's neglect for African American
lives and gay lives decimated by the AIDS pandemic, would achieve. She
opines that revealing truth, on its own, does not /move/ people to any
particular action or conclusion. She explains that "for someone to
have an unmystified, angry view of large and genuinely systemic
oppressions does not intrinsically or necessarily enjoin on that
persons to any specific train of epistemological or narrative
consequences" (123).

For example, she explores how shame operates like contagion. 

#+begin_quote
“Shame—-living, as it does, on and in the muscles and capillaries of
the face—-seems to be uniquely contagious from one person to another."
(63 Touching Feeling).
#+end_quote

For Sedgwick, shame as contagious brings out its mobilizing and
generative possibilites.

*** closing on adair and segwick

Adair here does for contagion what Sedgwick does for shame: turns
something that is traditionally seen as a negative into something that
may be generative and productive. Taking something that has been a
tool of oppression, and turning it into a creative resource.

Sedgwick explains that this kind of reading, reparative reading,
exposes “the ways selves and communities succeed in extracting
sustenance from the objects of a culture—-even of a culture whose
avowed desire has often been not to sustain them” (Touching Feeling

It is important to point out that Sedgwick's meditations on reading
method and their efficacy were prompted by a sense of disillusion
about the AIDS crisis, and lack of action by the US government. In
that essay, she wonders what the truth of exposure could achieve. 

*** data processing
So, now that we know these models function by prediction, we can talk
about how they are trained to make those predictions. They are trained
off data, that is, off of text. Models will go through many rounds of
training in order to be optimized for specific tasks.

The first round of training is called "base model training". And this
training is really only possible if you have access to many thousands
of dollars (often millions of dollars) worth of computer hardware,
energy, and labor. That kind of training is really only available to
big tech companies like Google, META, Amazon, Microsoft, which as you
know, all have their own competing models.

But after the base model is trained, then the model goes through
rounds of fine-tuning, which involves much shorter training runs on
much smaller datasets. This is a kind of training that's more
accessible, and someone with consumer hardware (and a little bit of
technical know-how) can do it on their own. This is the kind of
training that I decided to use to explore transphobia in the
legislative bills.

So, I needed first to create a dataset for training. I decided to
create a list of definitions around gender, with definitions of terms
like "gender identity," and "biological sex," for example. I then used
that list to fine-tune a model. The idea was that I could then query
the model, asking it questions like "what is sex" and "what is
gender," and see how it would respond. 

To create this dataset, I went through an intensive data preparation
process, which involved using the Python programming langauge to
scrape the legislative bill text and then extract definitions of
gender and related terms from it. I'll highlight some of the major
moves from this process.

(And I'll also say here that all of my Python code that I wrote for
this project is publically available, under my github profile, which
I'll link to at the end of this talk).

To extract the definitions of gender terms from these bills, the first
thing I did was to write a pattern matcher that can recognize terms
like "gender" and other related terms in text.

SLIDE - NER CODE

Here is a list of labels, which are the terms that are completely
capitalized, organized into the general categories "sex", "gender",
and "sexuality", with each label specifying a word pattern, like the
phrase "biological sex" for example. I tried to include various
formulations of each term. For example, "transgender" is delineated
three ways, as a single word, as a two-word phrase, and as a
hypthenated word. This ensures that I would capture most if not all
instances of the term.

Then, I used that pattern matcher as a basis for a more sophisticated
pattern matcher, which would search for those phrases if they are
contained within a particular sentence structure, like if they were
the subject of the sentence, followed by verbs like "means" or
"signifies" or "includes", or something related. I would show you that
code too, but it's going to look very confusing, and I think it will
create more problems than clarity.

SLIDE - MATCHER RESULTS

Her are the results from running the pattern matcher on the bill text.
Here, you can see that this matcher was sensitive enough to capture
longer phrases, like "gender transition surgery means" as well as
variants of how definitions are constructed, using the word "includes"
instead of "means", for example.

And here's some examples of the results after some cleaning and
formatting. I'll read a couple of them out loud.

SLIDE - DEFS

#+begin_quote
'The term gender identity means a persons self-perception of their
gender or claimed gender, regardless of the persons biological sex.',

'The term gender means the psychological, behavioral, social, and
cultural aspects of being male or female.',

'The term gender transition means the process in which an individual
goes from identifying with and living as a gender that corresponds to
his or her biological sex to identifying with and living as a gender
different from his or her biological sex, and may involve social,
legal, or physical changes.',
 
'The term biological sex means the indication of male or female sex by
reproductive potential or capacity, sex chromosomes, naturally
occurring sex hormones, gonads, or internal or external genitalia
present at birth.',
#+end_quote

In close reading this dataset, I am tempted to make the following
observations about how these definitions imply subtle but telling
assumptions about gender.

For example, I am interested in the word “regardless,” which appears
in many of the definitions, and along with the comma that precedes,
it, seems to partition gender from sex in the defintions. This
partition suggests a contrast between sex and gender that reifies
their binary opposition. Gender here is being defined without regard
to sex, as if notions of gender and sex do not influence each other,
and never blend into one another, or make productive use of each
other. Again I'm thinking here of Judith Butler, and her famous (and
contentious) claim that even seemingly physical phenomena, like
biological sex, is discursively produced.

In other definitions, I am interested in the words "self-perception"
and "claimed", and how a view of gender identity as a subjective
experience engages with behavioral or outward-expressing dimensions of
gender expression, which is another idea that has been addressed in
Queer Theory.

But this is not the kind of reading that I want to do with this
project. This kind of reading looks for what the definitions might
reveal about certain ideas about gender, sex, or sexuality. It is a
kind of paranoid reading, which looks for an underlying system of
oppression. Rather, I'm interested in what these definitions might
open up in our understanding of normativity, and the attachment to
normativity. 

*** about my results
Although I am still working on the right configurations for my
training, I do have some initial examples of how it is defining some
gender related terms.

SLIDE - MODEL GENERATION RESULTS

In these examples, the model is defining the terms "transgender" and
"gender affirmation".

As you can immediately notice from skimming the results, my model
displays a tendency to repeat itself, which is tendency of generating
not what is most expressive, but what is most plausible.
