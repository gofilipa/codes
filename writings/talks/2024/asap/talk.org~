* Plausibility and Passing: Using Ai To Study Anti-Trans Legislation
** notes from DJAI
[[~/Desktop/anti-trans-legislation/talks/design_justice/design.org][link to djai paper]]

Possiblity for tracing the language in the bills to an origin point?
To special interest groups that are providing the language? 
(Pamela)

On reading, "emerging textual practices":
- What is the state of the text when you're doing this analysis?
  (Kath) Does that matter?
- Differentiate between the different kinds of reading across
  different stages of the text. (Lauren)
- "as you put it in your question – what is being subtracted from
  ‘man’ – is this gender bias or discrimination or something
  different? What do we gain or lose by understanding these emerging
  textual practices through existing paradigms for understanding the
  sociomaterial production of difference?" (Kath)

On bias (from Kath):
- "Is it ever possible to remove bias? What is bias if it can be
  removed or added? Why are humans better able to ‘detect’ bias than
  nonhumans? Bias in the context of something that is removable
  suggests a single world in which things can be represented like or
  unlike what they are really, which seems to be a set of assumptions
  that queer theory and design justice have usefully undermined."
  (Kath)
- "if these textual formations are problematic, are there any that are
  not- or unproblematic? It seems to me from your presentation that
  you were exploring the indeterminate morality of textual-affective
  practices, but are these only possible – or perhaps only productive
  – when done in ‘literary’ or ‘human’ ways? I think the complexity of
  what it means for some practices to be a problem is what you’re
  raising when you say that it’s not what these LLMs/word embeddings
  are but what is done with them that is fraught… i.e. that they are
  enacted as if they are simply showing what is already there. But if
  that’s the case then that also challenges the idea of LLMs mirroring
  bias/discrimination in their datasets." (Kath)

What about using the dataset and applying it to just studying word
embeddings, creating a language model to query embeddings, or to look
at wordnet. Maybe trying to create a kind of foruma like hormones +
contagion = trans or something. (Kath)

Distinguish between transphobia and ant-material transness. There are
different kinds of attacks across different spaces (Funmi)

See Abiba Berhani and Discriminating Data.

My thoughts: 
The idea is not to remove bias, but to use the machine and statistical
processes to better understand the forms that bias takes in language.

** plans
I think I want to....

- run more experiments
  - get the data I need from the PDFs of state bills
  - train a word embedding model
  - keep working on tweaking parameters for the congressional dataset
  - start creating new datasets for the new congressional bills

Two interventions:
- ways of reading; determine a reading method, approach:
  - how to read transphobia in legislative text, in a way that doesn't
    just reveal transphobia, but does something else. 
    - the problem, I think, is that these definitions/texts reflect
      just a massive bias that already exists in the United States.
      And there's no way of my reading it that's going to change
      anything. So what do we do in the face of it?
      - This question, of what we are reading for, and how, and why,
        is the motivating one for this chapter.
      - Is there something in particular about gender and gender
        transition that we can understand here? 
    - reading along the method/tool:
      - we try to read for the mechanism, looking into the mechanical
        workings of the tool as a clue. What does it do to data, to
        forms? How does this mechanism offer a clue, a suggestion, for
        reading?
      - looking at the "plausibility" of output text, of how models
        work to normalize and regularize, to find the most
        statistically plausible next word.
        - how this drive toward plausibility mirror the "desire to
          pass" that trans studies scholars have read in trans
          subjects. A desire for conformity, for convention.
	- there are people who want to explode gender, and people who
          simply want to pass.
	- is there something about the regularization of language
          which we can then apply back to understand gender?
      - what do we see in the language of the output text, which has
        been regularized, what is on the surface of that language,
        what connections are opened?
- solidify my approach wrt trans studies
  - interest in contagion, connection to sexuality, desire, and fear.
    How to constellate all of these ideas.
    - transphobia: the fear that being trans can spread like a
      contagion. This is a popular fear, which engages in some way
      with the legislative language. 
    - how fear itself is contagious, spreading.
    - seduction as a means of identity formation.
    - is fear seductive? It spreads, but does it seduce?
      - in seduction there is a giving up of choice, of agency. It is
        a decision made through arousal. You do something that maybe
        you wouldn't have done if not aroused. (this is what I am
        talking about in my previous chapter... how the fuck am I just
        realizing it now). 

On reading trans studies:
- My interest in Trans Studies, and transphobia, is in dialogue with
  misinformation studies. That's part of the dimension of transphobia
  that I'm interested in.
- Some think Trans ought to focus on attachment to normativity, while
  others on resistance and radicality:
  - Chu and Drager: the focus in trans studies has been on resistance
    and radicality, when trans people just want to conform. It borrows
    too much from Queer Studies and cannot distinguish itself. 
    - all attempts to conform are nonnormative, even heterosexual
      ones, because "normativity is impossible"
  - Halberstam:
    - trans and queer blend and blur into each other--this is useful.
      They have the same target: normativity.
      - "if we are all females, then there are notranssexuals, no
        queers, no men. In the future, may I suggest, we who are
        queer, ortrans, or feminist might remain focused on a more
        conventional enemy: namely,the beneficiaries of
        hetero-patriarchal systems who, far from being females
        andhating it, are deeply invested in being males and loving
        it" (329).
      - Debates between "real vs performativity" by Prosser, Butler,
        and Halberstam (2005).
      - Debates on "cross-identification" and "cross-gender
        identification" by Bey and Manalansan. 
    - Chu's version of "female" posits femininity as lack, which is
      lacanian, second wave feminist, and an idea that Butler has done
      away with in "The Lesbian Phallus". See Kay Gabriel's LARB
      review (2019).

- prediction --> plausibility
  - the iterative shifting of vectors is a kind of approximation, or
    normalization of language, a tendency toward plausibility.
    - each step of the process, each iteration, gets closer and closer
      to a kind of mean, average, for that word's "meaning" in the
      data.
  - connection to trans studies affective modes as distinguished from
    queer ones:
    - attached to a norm rather than resisting norms
    - the desire to pass
  - could AI processes, as a kind of normalization of training data,
    be used to study the attachments to norms and the quotidian that
    characterizes--not trans affective modes--but those based on fear
    of transness?
    - AI is an apt tool to study the attachment to norms that
      characterizes transphobia, like ROGD. What might outputs from AI
      text generation suggest about the allure, the threat, the
      “seduction,” as Trans Studies scholar Cassius Adair puts it, of
      gender transgression?
  - Adair: contagion and seduction being a site of identity formation.
    Straight people do it all the time, using sex and sexuality as
    sites of identity formation.
    - Adair does for contagion what Sedgwick does for shame: turns
      something negative into a creative resource.

*** bank
  - gender as a subjective phenomenon, "claimed" "self-perception"
  - word "regardless" to distinguish gender from sex, seems to make
      them independent but actually reifies a binary opposition
      (Butler's subordinated realm).

** draft
*** thank you for having me
Thank you so much for having me here. 

I'm going to talk about a project that I've been working on for a
little over a year, which takes as its subject transphobia, and
particularly anti-trans discourse, which is currently proliferating
across this country.

To study this subject, I'm using technology, specifically, machine
learning, as a methodology.

I'm interested in how machine learning processes, in how predictive
algorithms, which reconfigure and reproduce the data that they are
trained with, can be used to study human bias, preconceptions,
contained within that same data. For this project, I train a machine
learning model off of data from current anti-trans legislation, which
is, legislation currently being proposed, debated, and passed all over
the country, which limits trans peoples' rights, legal recognition,
and access to healthcare. 

For this presentation, I'm going to focus on methodology.

First, I'm going to talk a little bit about readings methods, and
specifically, about ways of reading transphobia that engages existing
critical discourses in trans studies.

Then I'm going to turn to machine learning, and my attempts to use it
to explore the language of transphobia. Here I will get a little bit
technical, going "under the hood" of the machine, as it were, to
surface the underlying processes that constitute so called "deep
learning" methods.

Finally, I'll bring these two areas--trans studies and machine
learning--together. I will show how these two areas can
cross-illuminate one another. I will propose a reading practice that
uses "predictability" in machine learning to study transphobic
language, and in particular, how this language exhibits attachment to
normativity, what I call "plausibility."

(and what do I want from you? feedback on what you make of this
reading process, I guess?). 

*** legislation, transphobia, ROGD, littman
So I begin with my subject matter -- transphobia. This project looks
at transphobia within a legal discourse. As I'm sure you're aware, the
past 3 or 4 years has seen an incredible jump in the number of bills
being proposed and passed in state houses across the country and in
congress.

[SLIDE - ANTI TRANS LEGISLATION TRACKER - NEEDS NEW IMAGES]

As you can see in this chart, there has been a rising trend of
anti-trans legislation over the past several years, where each year
eclipses the previous one. The majority of these bills target
education, seeking to ban gender identity education, and students'
chosen names and pronouns, as well as healthcare, where many bills
outlaw gender-affirming care for minors and adults. The rest of the
bills mainly focus on trans peoples' participation in public spaces
and events, like drag performances and bathrooms, and also in sports.

[SLIDE - FEDERAL BILL NAMES]

- US HB1064: Ensuring Military Readiness Act of 2023
  - disqualifies transgender persons from military service
- US HB1276: Protect Minors from Medical Malpractice Act of 2023
  - doctors to be liable to all adverse effects (physical,
    psychological, etc) following trans-affirming care
- US HB1399: Protect Children’s Innocence Act
  - gender-affirming care on minors to be a felony
- US HB1490: Preventing Violence Against Female Inmates Act of 2023
  - incarcerating people by "biological sex"
- US HB216: My Child, My Choice Act of 2023
  - schools to obtain written parental consent before teaching
    anything related to gender/sex/sexuality.
- US HB3101: TPA Act Traditional Passport Act
  - passport gender designation to be binary and based on sex
- US HB3102: TSA Act Traditional Screening Application Act
  - prohibits "X" gender designation on TSA screenings

And here, you'll see a list of bill titles, like "Ensuring Military
Readiness Act," and "Protect Children's Innocence Act," which are
currently being debated in Congress. Just by scanning the titles, you
can perhaps grasp how many of these bills are undergirded by similar
assumptions, like that Americans need to be protected from gender
nonconformity. According to these bills, the groups most in need of
protection from trans people and trangender ideologies are minors, who
are "innocent", and cis women, who are physically vulnerable to
"violence". Alongside this investment in protection, is another
investment in maintaining tradition. We see "traditional passport,"
which preserves the binary gender identifications on passports, and
"traditional TSA," which keeps the binary gender designation on
security screeners (which is kind of hilarious, as I don't know
anybody that thinks TSA is a tradition that needs to be protected).
What I'm trying to surface here, is that underlying these bills, is an
attachment to the idea that transness, whatever else it might do,
constitutes a threat to American people and way of life.

The discourse that drives logic of threat and protection is a
particular kind of transphobia based on contagion. As particulurly
evident in the bills that limit or ban "gender affirming care" for
minors, this fear is propped by the assumption that transness can
spread from person to person, that it is a kind of social contagion.

SLIDE - LITTMAN'S PAPER

The fear is formalized in the false medical diagnosis, "Rapid-onset
Gender Dysphoria," or ROGD. This diagnosis, which has been rejected
and renounced by medical associations, was nonetheless popularized in
2018, in a very controversial paper by Lisa Littman. For that study,
Littman enlisted participants (parents of transgender adolescents)
from conservative and anti-trans online forums. Despite receiving
numerous criticisms for its methodology and lack of disclosures, the
paper has nonetheless had a significant influence on public perception
around Trans issues, especially as they affect minors. The idea has
seeped into public discourse, appearing in books, podcasts, and news
reports, and across social media.  

SLIDE - SHRIER BOOK COVER

One notable work in this vein, which is directed at a general
audience, is a book by Abigail Shrier, called "Irreversible Damage:
The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters." Shrier's thesis, which
becomes more and more explicit as the book progresses, is that minors,
who do not know what they want, cannot be trusted to make what she
calls "irreversable" decisions. According to Shrier, even something
like social transition, in which a person changes names, pronouns, and
dress, is dangerous.

I'm going to talk about her language. Unlike the language of the
bills, Shrier's tone throughout the book is highly ironic, an irony
that embeds interesting subtexts. 

SLIDE - SHRIER QUOTE

For example, there is a double meaning behind some of her
pronouncements, which is decipherable by her ironic tone.

She says things like: "if the government can’t force students to
salute a flag, the government can’t force a healthcare worker to utter
a particular pronoun. In America, the government can’t make people say
things--not even for the sake of politeness. Not for any reason at
all" (xx).

Here, Shrier makes a comparison to patriotism--in the flag salute--to
make a point about governmental authority. The point is that the
government cannot compel its citizenry (or anybody within its
jurisdiction) to express loyalty to the country's symbols. And just as
the country cannot compel patriotic expression, so it cannot compel
respect (or here, she refers to it as "politeness") for a person's
preferred gender designation.

Through this comparision to the patriotism, and the framing of the
issue around expression, the subtext here seems to be that forcing
pronoun usage would be fascist. Which is, I think, a strange way to
make a point to what is likely a readership that I imagine is highly
invested in conservative ideals.

Unless, reading this statement through the frame of irony, the point
is precisely that some kinds of expression should be free while others
should not. That we have the right to question each other's genders
but not, but never, the flag. Essentially, if citizens cannot be
compelled to address such a providential institution according to
their personal feelings, then of course, they have the right to
address an individual how they like. Unironically, the sentence could
be saying something like, "look, our government cannot even force you
to respect it. How admirable, how humble, that a nation would endow
its own citizens with the right to disrespect it! Anybody who does so,
is undeniably selfish."

In this reading, we can trace an attachment to patriotism to an
attachment to gender norms (perhaps with a stop at white supremacy on
the way there). And we can see how the structure, what Patricia Hill
Collins calls "the matrix of domination," works.

But this is exactly the kind of reading that I don't want to do for
this project. Because the more that I engage with the material, the
more that I listen to the news of another trans bill being proposed in
this country, the more I am convinced that this particular historical
moment, a moment of multiplying misinformation, needs another mode of
reading.

*** sedgwick, paranoia, shame, movement
Here I am inspired by the origins of my own field, which is Queer
Studies. As many of you know, one of the major figures of this field
is Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, who, throughout the trajectory of her career
explored various reading methods and modes of relation to text.  

SLIDE - EPISTEMOLOGY

In her early work, such as /The Epistemology of the Closet/, Sedwick
practices a mode of critical analysis based on what Foucault's "logic
of repression," that seeks out hidden meanings and power relations in
text. In this book, she exposes the unstable binaries between
heterosexual and homosexual categories — where one term is not simply
symmetrical or subordinated to another, but rather, depends the other
for its meaning through what she calls "simultaneous subsumption and
exclusion" (10). As an "epistemology of the closet," this method mines
language forms for what is hidden, what is beneath the surface, and
what that closet reveals about power relations and structures.

SLIDE - sedgwick paranoid/reparative essay

Years later, however, Sedgwick changes course. In the wake of the AIDS
crisis, she experiences an upheaval of doubt about the efficacy of
critical methods. This doubt opens what is perhaps her most famous
essay, "Paranoid Reading and Reparative Reading: Or, you're so
paranoid you probably think this essay is about you" (such a great
title). In this essay, Sedgwick wonders what any explanation, any
unearthing of the government's neglect (or outright disdain) for
African American lives and gay lives decimated by the AIDS pandemic,
would change. She considers that the act of reading to reveal or to
expose truth, which she calls "supicious" or "paranoid reading," does
not /move/ people to any particular action or conclusion. She explains
that "for someone to have an unmystified, angry view of large and
genuinely systemic oppressions does not intrinsically or necessarily
enjoin on that persons to any specific train of epistemological or
narrative consequences" (123).

What if, she asks, we consider ways of knowing not oriented around
suspicion and paranoia? This would be a critical practice that
"mov[es] from the rather fixed question Is a particular piece of
knowledge true, and how can we know? to the further questions: what
does knowledge do–-the pursuit of it, the having and exposing of it"
(124, Touching Feeling).

To demonstrate, Sedgwick takes an affect that is traditionally seen as
negative and examines how it create productive and generative effects
in text. She takes shame, which is a structuring force in queer
identity, and explores its significatory possibilites. She describes
shame as:

SLIDE - SHAME QUOTES

#+begin_quote
“a kind of free radical that (in different people and different
cultures) attaches to and permanently intensifies or alters the
meaning of—-of almost anything: a zone of the body, a sensory system,
a prohibited or indeed a permitted behavior, another affect such as
anger or arousal, a named identity, a script for interpreting other
people’s behavior toward oneself” (62)
#+end_quote

Rather than, as much Queer Theory is happy to do, plumb and trace the
ways that shame hides and represses sexuality, Sedgwick reads it as a
vehicle for connection, pulling other affects and images into
relation.

She even likens shame to a kind of contagion, bringing out the ways it
can spread from person to person, evoking its ability to mobilize and
generate:

#+begin_quote
“Shame—-living, as it does, on and in the muscles and capillaries of
the face—-seems to be uniquely contagious from one person to another."
(63 Touching Feeling).
#+end_quote

HERE

I'm interested in this move that Sedgwick makes, of taking what is
typically seen as a negative, repressive affect, like shame, and
seeing how it opens up possibilities for reading new connections in
text that would otherwise be harmful. Specifically, I wonder how one
might read something productive in fear--in the phobia--that pervades
anti-trans discourse. How can we apply this attention to movement and
connection to reading fear in language, that is, language generated by
a large language model?

**** reading patriarchy and patriotism in the language -> attachment 
The purpose of the bills, admitted in the language of their titles, to
guard these groups, speaks to a quite literally patriarchical motives.
(And we all know that patriarchy is bad.)

There is an attachment here, some kind of attachment, to normativity,
to keeping things as traditional as possible.

            (4) XX or XY sex reversal; and

            (5) ovotesticular disorder.




** processing and training
Now I will talk a little bit about my data gathering and model
training process. My goal was to "fine-tune" (that is, customize an
already trained model) with data from the anti-trans legislation. I am
interested specifically in the language outlawing gender transition
from these bills.

So, I decided to create a list of definitions around gender, with
definitions of terms like "gender identity," and "biological sex," for
example. I then used that list to fine-tune an llm for text
generation. The idea was that I could then query the model, asking it
questions like "what is sex" and "what is gender".

In what follows, I'm going to outline a bit of the data gatherering
and model training processes.

SLIDE 9 - HUGGINGFACE DATASETS

The first dataset that I created is now available on HuggingFace
Datasets. For those of you who don't know, HuggingFace is a platform
for sharing Machine Learning projects and tools, much like Github.
This dataset consists of definitions of "gender" and related terms
from congressional and senate bills, from the last two years.

To create this dataset, I went through an intensive data preparation
process, which involved using the Python programming langauge to
scrape the bill text and then extract definitions of gender and
related terms from it. I'll highlight some of the major moves from
this process. (And I'll also say here that all of my Python code that
I wrote for this project is publically available, under my github
profile, which I'll link to at the end of this talk).

To extract the definitions of gender terms from these bills, the first
thing I did was to write a pattern matcher, known technically as a
"named entity recognizer" (for those of you familiar with NLP), that
can recognize terms like "gender" and other related terms in text.

SLIDE 10 - NER CODE

Here is a list of labels, organized into the general categories "sex",
"gender", and "sexuality", with each label specifying a word pattern,
like the phrase "biological sex" for example. I tried to include
various formulations of each term, for example, "transgender" is
delineated three ways, as a single word, as a two-word phrase, and as
a hypthenated word. This ensures that I would capture most if not all
instances of the term.

Then, I used that entity recognizer as a basis for a more
sophisticated pattern matcher, which would search for those phrases if
they are contained within a definition.

SLIDE 11 - MATCHER CODE

For those of you familiar with the JSON data format, you can perhaps
grasp the pattern matcher's logic here. It starts by searching for
punctuation, then looking for a gender term (pulling from the entity
recognizer code), along with some wild card terms, just in case there
are extra words or punctuation in the definition. Finally, it ends
with terms that are common in definitions, like "means", "signifies",
or "includes."

SLIDE 12 - MATCHER RESULTS

From its results, pictured here, you can see that this matcher was
sensitive enough to capture longer phrases, like "gender transition
surgery means" as well as variants of how definitions are constructed,
using the word "includes" instead of "means", for example.

And here's some examples of the results after some cleaning and
formatting. I'll read a couple of them out loud.

SLIDE 13 - DEFS

#+begin_quote
'The term gender identity means a persons self-perception of their
gender or claimed gender, regardless of the persons biological sex.',

'The term gender means the psychological, behavioral, social, and
cultural aspects of being male or female.',

 'The term gender transition means the process in which an individual
 goes from identifying with and living as a gender that corresponds to
 his or her biological sex to identifying with and living as a gender
 different from his or her biological sex, and may involve social,
 legal, or physical changes.',
 
 'The term biological sex means the indication of male or female sex
 by reproductive potential or capacity, sex chromosomes, naturally
 occurring sex hormones, gonads, or internal or external genitalia
 present at birth.',
#+end_quote

In close reading the dataset, I immediately notice how some
assumptions are being constructed in subtle and seemingly neutral
ways. For example, in the first definition, I am interested in the
words "self-perception" and "claimed", and how a view of gender
identity as a subjective experience engages with behavioral dimensions
of gender expression, at least as it has been theorized by Queer
Studies scholars like Judith Butler.

I am also interested in the word “regardless,” which appears in almost
half of the definitions, and suggests a contrast between sex and
gender that seems to reify a binary opposition or between the two. In
other words, gender as being defined without regard to sex, as if
notions of gender and sex do not influence each other, and never blend
into one another, or make productive use of each other. Again I'm
thinking here of Judith Butler, and her famous (and contentious) claim
that even seemingly physical phenomena, like biological sex, is
discursively produced.

As I continue to build and clean my datasets, I've also been dabbling
with using them to train AI models.

Throughout this fine-tuning process, which I will outline briefly, I
discovered a suggestive connection to reading practices, specifically
the way that we analyze concepts like transphobia from a humanistic
perspective.

As you may already know, machine learning models work by prediction.
They turn semantic expressivity into something that can be computed
and guessed. From its training data, the model compiles numerical
probabilities for each word's relationship to other words in the
database. It represents these probabilities with numbers, with
actually a very large list of numbers, known technically as "word
vectors." The model then uses math to calculate what word should
follow a given word.

The training process, as I understand it (and I have no formal
education in machine learning), can be reduced to three steps, or
mathematical functions.

SLIDE 14 - LIST OF FUNCTIONS

1. first, the hypothesis function
2. second, the loss function
3. third, the minimizing loss function

First, because the machine doesn't know what words mean, it makes a
"guess." (This is called the hypothesis function), Here, it populates
each word with a vector, consisting of random numbers. These vectors
are just a starting point.

Then, after making this guess, it moves to the next step, where the
machine checks its prediction against the actual result--that is, it
will compare the prediction vector against the actual result's vector.
It's prediction will be wrong, but that doesn't matter. It compares
between the two, the prediction and the result, and calculates the
difference between them. This calculation is made by using what's
called the "loss function."

Finally, it moves to the minimizing this "loss", which employs
algorithms from calculus (like gradient descent) in order to /very
slightly/ adjust the vectors so that they are closer to the intended
result. The adjustments here are very incremental. But with enough of
them, the model can reach /almost zero difference/ between the
prediction and the actual result.

With enough training data, LLMs can be really good generating content
that is plausible. However, while they can guess or improvise, they
are not at all good at being creative, at innovating. A language model
can only generate what it has already seen before. Even a phenomenon
like “hallucination,” that a language model spews text that has no
bearing in reality, is based on the tendency of models to repeat what
they've already seen. They hallucinate not because they are creative
or random, but because they are designed from statistical processes to
generate what is most plausible rather than accurate.

Although I am still working on the right configurations for my
training, I do have some initial examples of how it is defining some
gender related terms.

SLIDE 15 - RESULTS

In these examples, the model is defining the terms "transgender" and
"gender affirmation".

As you can immediately notice from skimming the results, my model
displays a tendency to repeat itself, which is tendency of generating
not what is most expressive, but what is most plausible.

** plausibility
Thinking back to this fine-tuning process, I read this iterative
shifting of vectors is a kind of /approximation/ or even
/normalization/ of language, which is based on plausibility. And this
tendency toward plausibility creates an interesting connection to
conversations in Trans Studies about trans affective modes. Typically,
these scholars describe trans affective modes by distinguishing them
from "queer" modes. 

SLIDE 16 - TRANS AFFECTS

For example, Trans Studies scholar Eliza Steinbock explains that,

#+begin_quote
“trans analytics have (historically, though not universally) a
different set of primary affects than queer theory. Both typically
take pain as a reference point, but then their affective interest
zags. Queer relishes the joy of subversion. Trans trades in quotidian
boredom. Queer has a celebratory tone. Trans speaks in sober detail.”
#+end_quote

Other Trans Studies scholars like Marquis Bey and Andrea Long Chu have
made similar points; with Bey making the point that queer's
intervention can be described as "anti" or militant, while trans is
"non" or based in refusal ("Thinking with Trans Now"); and Chu has
remarked that trans studies, rather than resisting norms, "requires
that we understand–-as we never have before–-what it means to be
attached to a norm, by desire, by habit, by survival" ("After Trans
Studies" 108).

It seems to me--there is a fascinating connection between how language
models approach language, what they do to language (the normalization
or approximation) of language, and what Trans Studies scholars defines
as a central desire to /pass/.

This makes me wonder, could AI-generated text, as a kind of
approximation, a normalization, of its training data, be used to study
the attachments to norms and the quotidian that characterizes--not
trans affective modes--but those based on fear of transness?

Thinking in this way, AI may be an apt tool to study the attachment to
norms that characterizes transphobia, like perspectives driven by the
fear of ROGD. What might outputs from AI text generation suggest about
the allure, the threat, the “seduction,” as Trans Studies scholar
Cassius Adair puts it, of gender transgression? 

Speaking on trans erotics, and specifically “trans for trans” or "t4t
erotics," Adair asks, "Why shouldn't transness be transmissible or
contagious? Why can't the erotic be a site of producing trans identity
or practices?" He points out that, after all, cis people do it all the
time: they use sexuality and sexual encounters as sites of identity
formation.

Adair here does for contagion what Sedgwick does for shame: turns
something that is traditionally seen as a negative into something that
may be generative and productive. Taking something that has been a
tool of oppression, and turning it into a creative resource.

Sedgwick explains that this kind of reading, reparative reading,
exposes “the ways selves and communities succeed in extracting
sustenance from the objects of a culture—-even of a culture whose
avowed desire has often been not to sustain them” (Touching Feeling
151).
