<p>
I'm going to talk about my experience teaching programming to students
who all use AI tools.
</p>

<p>
Most recently, this summer, I taught an intermediate level programming
course titled "How To Build A Bot", which was about learning how to
automate processes with the Python programming language. For those who
don't know, bots are applications that interact with webpages in
autonomous ways, like downloading data from webpages or posting to
social media sites. Over the semester, which ended last Monday,
students built various "bots" that did different things.
</p>

<p>
SLIDE
<a href="https://github.com/aliceaviggiani/map-bot">https://github.com/aliceaviggiani/map-bot</a>
<a href="https://github.com/petewise9/eBay_Scraper/">https://github.com/petewise9/eBay_Scraper/</a>
</p>

<p>
For example, one bot checked ebay every day for new listings of
particular pokemon cards, and saved those listings to a spreadsheet;
another bot posted images and provenance information of rare maps on
instagram.
</p>

<p>
What's impressive is that all of my students came to this class with
little to no experience with programming&#x2014;and they all built things
that they wouldn't have been able to build two or three years ago.
From starting almost at zero, they left the course with functional
applications that did things in the world. They were able to do this
for one reason: because they had access to free AI tools.
</p>

<p>
What most of them found useful was the debugging capabilities, the
ability of AI-powered coding tools to toubleshoot and fix their code.
In that sense, errors that would have previously taken hours or days
to resolve could be resolved in seconds.
</p>

<p>
Although that was also a double-edged sword. The suggested fixes
didn't always work, and when they did work, they often led to more
errors down the road, or to convoluted looking code that takes more
steps than necessary to fix the problem.
</p>

<p>
In a funny example, one of my students, who was totally new to
programming, described his experience interacting with an AI bot as if
he was trying to convince or guide it toward a specific conclusion. He
would say things like, "It's coming around", and "Its almost there".
</p>

<p>
In my head, I got the image of the Hulk trying to sew a button.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
You have something super powerful, and it's attempting to perform a
very delicate task.
</p>

<p>
The good news is that this lowers the barrier of entry significantly.
But I also want to say, perhaps controversially, that maybe it's not a
great thing that programming is more accessible.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps, people should be able toq build just anything with little to
no prior understanding of programming. Not because they aren't
genuinely interested in programming (though I think that is important)
but because we should have some limits on what we can make. Creating
should not be so easy.
</p>

<p>
And the reason is that, even though programming applications exist on
computer screens, operating seemingly independantly from material
constraints, these things are very much tied to physical and sometimes
distant components like hardware chips and data centers, as well as
live, human components like data labelling and cleaning, and of
course, content creation in the first place.
</p>

<p>
And for every single one of those points that I just mentioned, AI
companies are extracting value and labor without proper compensation.
Not only that, where it concerns the physical materials, they are
doing so to the effect of massive ecological harm. I'm not going to go
into details, but in the global south, there are instances in Congo,
Kenya, Thailand, and other places where water and earth is now toxic,
creating health problems, destroying crops, and forcing the relocation
of communities. And if people think this is limited to the global
south, pay attention to what is going on in Tennessee right now, over
the past several weeks, where Elon Musk has built a new (and
unpermitted) data center.
</p>

<p>
While there's a big stack of exploitation operating out of view from
our screens, those who are in charge of the technology, who are
leading these companies, seem to always speak about AI in terms of
abundance. There are so many clips of Sam Altman going glassy eyed as
he revels over the possibility that every human will have access to
their own personalized "intelligence."
</p>

<pre class="example">
Here's one example of the kind of language he uses: 

If you think about how different the world can be, not only when every
person has... ChatGPT... but next they have the world's best chief of
staff. And then after that, every person has a company of 20 or 50
experts that can work super well together. And then after that,
everybody has a company of 10,000 experts in every field that can work
super well together. And if someone wants to go focus on curing
disease, they can do that. And if someone wants to focus on making
great art, they can do that.   
</pre>

<p>
To this prospect, I say no. We don't need "intelligence" to create
things in order to have a world of abundance. We don't need it,
because we have it already. The world is here, and it's abundant.
</p>

<p>
What we actually need is to slow down and think about how to make that
existing abundance accessible to the most amount of people possible.
</p>

<pre class="example">

To demonstrate that idea, I'll end with a project from one of my
students. This project uses AI tools to build something
reflextive and analytical, rather than productive or profitable. 

    SLIDE
    https://github.com/jfung53/mensmagbot

The project is an image generator generates a text snippet based on
content about masculinity. Basically, it scrapes websites that are
intended toward a male audience, like GQ and Mens' Health, and uses
that dataset to train an AI model to generate text. She uses prompts
like

    SLIDE masculinity prompts

Then, she uses prompts like ...

#+begin_quote
    "Men can be",
    "Modern men are",
    "Masculinity can be",
    "Every man should",
    "Any guy would",
    "Real men",
    "Male friendship is",
    "Manhood is",
    "Being a father means",
    "Being a gentleman means"
#+end_quote

And she gets results like:

SENTENCES

I think work like this is super useful, especially considering the
lack of attention masculinity by itself gets in cultural studies
contexts.

(For example, while there is "womens' studies", "queer studies",
"asian studies", "black studies", there is no "mens studies". And
although some people might scoff and say most fields implicitly
center mens' perspectives, and while that may be true, that is all
the more reason why mens' studies should can examine this in
isolation). 

Coming back to this project --- this is an example that doesn't
build just to produce, but builds for the sake of being analytical.
It adds a new kind of knowledge to the world, not just another
product or tool.
