*** answers to questions:

1. What do concepts from Queer Studies and adjacent fields offer to
   computational tools for working with text?
   - [queer theory concept], offers an approach to [computational
     tool] that [does this to text].
     1. The Queer Studies concept of Gender Performativity offers an
        approach to text analysis that surfaces multiplicity in
        language meaning.
     2. QOCC's concept of dis-identification offers an approach to
        textual markup that delineates irreconcilable interpretations
        of language.
     3. Black Feminist Studies' concept of the flesh offers an
        approach for analyzing software that is grounded in the
        physicality and materiality of screen display.
     4. Trans Studies' concept of normativity offers an approach to
        text generation that reveals shared investments across
        identity and subject groups.

2. How do these computational tools constrain the expressive potential
   of language into data?
   - [Constraint] [does something] to language [to make it this].
     1. In text analysis, "loops" strips language of idiosyncracies in
        order to count its common features.
     2. In textual markup, "tags" disambiguate and fix language to
        sort it into discrete elements within an ordered hierarchy.
     3. In text display, layers of computer software displace language
        processing away from human awareness in order to streamline
        interface effects.
     4. In text generation, algorithmic prediction aggregates language
        expressions to generalize and approximate patterns of language
        use.
	
3. How do concepts from Queer Studies and adjacent fields work against
   constraints in text data?
   - Queer studies [concept] [does a thing to work within and against
     constraint]
     1. From the concept of iteration, the emphasis on repetition
        inspires a text analysis practice that multiplies and
        re-signifies word meaning.
     2. From the concept of dis-identification, the appropriation of
        dominant codes influences a markup strategy that delineates
        the gaps between tagging structures.
     3. From the concept of the flesh, the foreclosure of depth
        suggests reading layers of software as intimate and physical
        screen effects.
     4. From the concept of normativity, the desire for conformity
        guides analysis toward shared investments between polarized
        perspectives.
** book argument
Concepts from Queer Studies and adjacent fields offer methodological
approaches to computational tools that work with text-based data. Such
tools, which are used for tasks like text generation, preservation,
and display, tend to constrain language about gender, sex, and
sexuality, stripping its idiosyncrasies and ambiguities, to turn it
into computable units of data. Queer Studies and adjacent fields
inspire methodologies for working against these
constraints---methodologies that destabilize authoritative and
delimiting structures, and open novel readings of language data. By
engaging closely and attentively with these computational processes,
users can resist the reductive ways that technology works upon
expression.

  - scope and evidence type:
    - Computational text analysis algorithms like Logistic Regression,
      Burrow's Delta, semantic similarity
    - Queer Studies' theory of Gender Performativity
    - Woolf's /Orlando/, (Rosenberg's /Confessions of the Fox/ or
      /Nightwood/ or /Fun Home/). 
  - main claims:
    - claim: Text analysis methods that reduce complexity and
      variability of gender expression into binary forms can be
      "iterated" through different vantage points (close and distant)
      to surface multiplicity.
      - That dominant methods in text analysis use algorithms in a
        way that close off the kinds of readings we can peform on
        gender.
      - Python processes text to diminish peculiarities and move
        toward abstract connections.
      - One can iterate over binary structures in algorithms to open
        up, rather than collapse, possible associations in gender
        terms.
  - metacommentary:
    - Words have inherent multiplicity, meaning is always expanding
      beyond the binary. (But also, meaning is discursive,
      disembodied--lacking material realities, whitewashed).
- Chapter 2:
  - topic: text encoding and sexuality
  - scope and evidence type:
    - textual scholarship and queer historiographical approaches to
      preservation.
    - TEI technology and projects that attempt to markup complex
      sexual IDs,
    - The first 3 chapters of the manuscript of Dorian Gray (maybe
      /Nightwood/, /Confessions/).
  - main claims:
    - TEI imposes not just disambiguation between elements but also a
      power structure which delimits what can and cannot be said.
    - Hierarchical formats that categorize data can also suggest
      implicit power structures that delimit what is sayable and
      permissable.
    - We cannot mark up what has been lost, but we can see our own
      complicity in power structures.
  - metacommentary:
    - Meaning is inherent in organization and structure, controlling
      what can and cannot be signified. (Markup, inclusion into
      systems, isn't enough).
- Chapter 3:
  - topic: text display and sex
  - scope and evidence type:
    - Media archaeology theorizing on materiality.
    - Black feminist theorizing on the flesh.
    - The novel /Dawn/ by Octavia Butler and the electronic literary
      work, /skinonskinonskin/ by /Entropy8Zuper/.
  - main claims:
    - The collision between thinking and feeling surfaces the tension
      of where is sensuality.
    - The surface (screen layer) of computing obscures the depths of
      material processing. 
    - Across layers of display and source code, surface effects are
      unmappable, fugitive, displaced, enabling significatory
      possbilities (connectivity, intimacy) that resist technological
      constraints. The pairing down to surface enables connectivity,
      intimacy.
      - Materiality exists even in abstracted forms, and points to
        significatory possibilities that resist circumscription.
  - metacommentary:
    - The materiality of the sign offers a way of working within
      reductive signification processes.
- Chapter 4:
  - topic: text generation and sex (gendered embodiment)
  - scope and evidence type:
    - Trans studies on normativity and embodiment
    - Machine learning technology and training process
    - Popular, online journalism and reality tv
  - main claims:
    - Machine learning is a tool of approximation, reducing meaning to
      common denominators and flattening perspectives to univocality.
    - It can be used to find similar investments across polarizing
      perspectives.
  - metacommentary:
    - univocality is a way of finding shared investments.

** organizing principle
Each chapter takes a different process for working with text,
identifies a computational constraint that reduces textual detail in
some way, and finds a way of working the constraint into a
close-reading practice.

- process for working with text -> constraint
1. text analysis -> iteration (loops)
2. text encoding -> containment (tags)
3. text display -> abstraction (display)
4. text generation -> aggregation (prediction algoirthms)
   
- constraint -> what it does to data -> how to resist 
1. iteration -> regularizes/homogenizes data -> repeat with difference
2. containment -> leaves out data -> narrate between gaps
3. abstraction -> displaces data -> close reading source code
4. aggregation -> averages data -> finding common ground

Cowan, T. L., and Jas Rault. Heavy Processing. punctum books, 2024.

This book demonstrates a methodology, called "heavy processing," for
doing dritical work at the intersection of DH, Info Studies, Data
Studies, which is focused on trans-feminist and queer ("TFQ") lives.
It arose out of an ambitious digtal archival project centered on TFQ
cabarets, what they ended up with is the "prequel" (23). Realized that
before getting to the tools, they need to dwell with the prior steps
of being critical about method and theory.

Proposes "heavy processing" as a methodology that involves dwelling
with thorny or difficult questions, "a proclivity for and commitment
to dialectical discussion sparked by difference and creativity" (74).
Employs digital components or concepts as metaphors for critical work:
CPU, IT, Networks.

This book constellates many of the fields that I consider in my own,
but it does not... 

**** queer data studies
Patrick Keilty, Ed. /Queer Data Studies/. University of Washington
Press, 2024. $30.00

This book is the only substantial treatment of the field of Queer Data
Studies. It comprises a collection of essays organized around the
theme of "queer data," which is taken up in a variety of contexts,
including Black Studies, machine learning, sex work, HIV Studies, and
Science and Technology Studies (STS). This book's main contribution is
its critical stance on data, pointing out that "Queer people have
complex, sometimes contradictory relationships to data" (11). It
explores common heuristics, like opacity, ephemerality, and messiness,
within Queer Studies and related fields, and how these inflect topics
of surveillance, privacy, autonomy, and soverignty in data.

As an edited collection, however, there cannot be a sustained
examination of digital tools or processes involved in working with
data, which is where my own project intervenes with its deep readings
of computational mechanism.

Additionally, my book's expansion beyond the field of Queer Studies
puts concepts like embodiment and the flesh, from Trans and Black
Feminist Studies, into orbit with Queer Studies.

Paragraph 1: What does my book as a whole do?
- [X] my book's topic: Computational methods for working with language
  about queerness.
- [X] book argument (see above)
- [X] implicit lesson:
  - By engaging closely and sensually with a technology, we can find
    ways of resisting its reductions, the ways it works upon us.
  - Experimenting with how something works in depth and in a sensual
a    way will liberate us from being used and being users
- [X] To answer this question, I apply concepts from QS and related
  fields to work against constraints in computation using examples
  from literature as my test case. [or see evidence base above].

Paragraph 2: How does this book as a whole proceed? (how do the
arguments unfold over the chapters)
- [X] organizing principle (see above): Each chapter takes a different
  process for working with text, identifies a computational constraint
  within that process, and finds a way of working that constraint into
  a close-reading practice.
- [X] narrative arc (chapter 8)
  - moving from simple concepts to the complex processes.
    - introducing humanists to how computers work on a fundamental
      level. We start with the simple, with counting and categorizing,
      then we get deeper into stacks and machine learning.
    - the first two chapters are about simpler processes, counting and
      tagging, and the latter chapters are about more complex
      processes, abstraction and prediction.
      - I see other parallels between the two parts: the first part
        being about creating destabilization, and the second part
        about re-stabilizing; the first about queer theory and its
        methods, the second about adjacent fields and it's methods.
- [X] describe book structure (chapter 11):
  - The book is divided into two parts: part one, which explores core
    concepts in computation: chapter 1 explores counting, which is the
    bedrock of all analysis tasks; chapter 2 explores tagging which is
    the foundation of data formatting and structure. Then, part two
    explores more complex processes: chapter 3 explores
    interface/display processes, and chapter 4 explores text
    generation. The second half builds on concepts from the first to
    show more complex tools. Word vectors (ch 1) -> neural net
    training (ch 4), markup languages (ch 2)- > html code interacting
    with javascript (ch 3).
    
Paragraphs for body chapters:
- [ ] what does this chapter do in service of the book?
- [ ] start with a topic sentence from "what stays the same, what
  changes": 
  - from chapter one to chapter two: We move from text analysis to
    text encoding, from counting to markup. They are both basic,
    foundational acts of working with text data, but while analysis is
    about regularizing data to be counted, markup is about appending
    descriptive information to sort and structure data.
    - Impact:
      - Markup shows the implicit ways that data formats pre-
        determine what kind of information can be contained within
        them. This information has to do with power structures that
        delimit what can and cannot be said. "Occluding whiteness".
      - It also brings to the surface (in another way) how QS has
        looked over race and materializations. In the previous
        chapter, we found that the trope of fluidity overlooks
        material reality. In this chapter, we find that there is no
        formalization that will recuperate what has been left out of
        the structure. That the task must be otherwise.
  - from chapter two to chapter three: Looking at a more complex
    process, which is abstraction and display of data. Moving into
    Black Feminist studies, to find ways of addressing material
    concerns. We return to the materiality of the word, a stabilizing
    force.
    - Impact:
      - Now we can really "go deeper" than we did in previous
        chapters, where we merely dipped our toes.
      - We are zooming out to look at how a larger process, of
        abstraction, works on data. There is more complexity, we've
        learned more about how computation works to get here,
        regularizing data, plain text formatting, in particular, which
        helps the reader understand data stacks and how they work.
  - from chapter three to chapter four: Looking at algorithmic
    prediction and how that works to normalize data, similar to what
    we discussed in the first chapter. Moving to Trans Studies, to
    address underlying investments in normativity.
    - Impact:
      - The approximation of language revealing shared investments
        across political poles. Like the previous chapter, something
        shared, something solid.

Counter-Code: Queer Revisions of Language Technologies

This book revisions computational processes that work with language.
It applies concepts from Queer Studies and related fields to
interrogate and re-work computational processes that flatten the
complexity of language data. It shows how certain computational tasks,
like text analysis, tend to constrain the expressive potential of
language forms, stripping them of idiosyncrasies and ambiguities, to
turn them into computable units of data. Fields like Queer Studies,
Black Feminist Studies, and Trans Studies inspire methodologies for
working against these constraints—methodologies that destabilize
authoritative and delimiting structures and open novel readings of
language data. /Counter-Code/ applies these methodologies to samples
of Queer literature, to explore how these methods work on digital
expressions of sex, gender, and sexuality. By engaging closely with
these computational processes, and learning how they work under the
hood, the reader will discover tools for resisting the ways that
technology constrains and determines language meaning.

Each chapter of this book takes up a computational process for working
with text and uses that process to study a component of queer identity
expressed in a sample of Queer literature. Within each computational
process, the chapter identifies a constraint—a mechanism that
transforms and reduces a component of queer identity into computable
data. The earlier chapters focus on basic technical processes, like
counting and tagging language data, while the later chapters move
toward more complex processes of visual display and algorithmic
prediction. Chapter one, “Text Analysis,” uses text analysis to study
gender in Virginia Woolf's Orlando: A Biography. Chapter two, “Text
Preservation,” turns to text preservation methods to trace the
suppression of homosexuality in Oscar Wilde's novel, The Picture of
Dorian Gray. The third chapter “Text Display,” reads examples of
sensuality and physicality across print and electronic formats, in
Octavia Butler's novel, Dawn, and a work of electronic literature,
entitled skinonskinonskin, by the net artist, Entropy8Zuper!. The
fourth chapter, “Text Generation,” experiments with algorithmic
prediction to analyze themes of gendered embodiment from a reality TV
dating show, Love is Blind. Moving from canonical works of Queer
Literature and Queer Studies in its early chapters to more eclectic
source material, like science fiction and reality TV in the latter
chapters, this book expands the repertoire of “Queer” beyond its
institutional use.

Counter-Code also asks how Queer Studies as a field might inspire the
critique and revision of technological systems. Developing queer for
the future, the book argues, involves collaborating across adjacent
fields to compile a strategic and flexible set of methodological
tools. Queer Studies offers powerful methodologies for disrupting
existing structures of meaning-making, such as gender performativity
and disidentification, the theories that drive the arguments in the
book's first two chapters. Drawing from these theories, these early
chapters propose strategies for resistance that work against
totalizing structures from inside their logics. Meanwhile, however,
other fields like Black Feminist Studies and Trans Studies offer
methods that are outside of or beside such structures. These methods
ground meaning in lived embodiment, offering new imaginaries based on
material realities and shared affinities. Drawing from these adjacent
fields, the chapters in the second half of the book thus respond to
the threads spun in the first half, bringing both critique and
imaginative work to the goal of re-visioning technological systems.

The author, Filipa Calado, is a self-taught programmer who uses
digital tools to study queerness. Trained in English Literature at the
Graduate Center, CUNY, she is now an Assistant Professor
(tenure-track) at Pratt Institute, School of Information, where she
teaches classes on programming, automation, Information Studies, and
the Digital Humanities. Her research spans various tools that work
with language, like text analysis algorithms, markup languages, and
programming languages. Most recently, she experiments with language
modelling (LLMs) as a method for close-reading, with a focus on how
algorithmic processes transform linguistic expressions of sex, gender,
and sexuality into computable data. In her published work, she aims to
reach the widest possible audience, writing for Humanities and Natural
Language Processing (NLP) venues. Her essays have appeared in the
collection, Digital Editing & Publishing in the 21st Century, and in
the journals, The Open Library of Humanities Journal and The Journal
for Interactive Technology and Pedagogy, as well as the conference
proceedings for GeBNLP: The 6th Workshop on Gender Bias in Natural
Language Processing. Her coding projects, which she authors herself
and publishes online under open licenses, are available on Github and
Huggingface (See the repositories under Calado, Filipa).

Counter-Code is situated in an emerging subfield of Digital Humanities
(DH), called Queer DH, at the intersection of Queer Studies and DH.
However, the book is written to appeal beyond this relatively niche
field, to reach readers from Queer Studies and general Humanities
backgrounds, who are nontechnical but interested in learning about
digital tools and frameworks. Secondly, the book will appeal to
readers coming from the field of DH more broadly, who may have
additional interests in Queer Studies and/or Literary Studies. The
book’s pedagogical focus, which assumes no prior technical knowledge,
but slowly builds this knowledge over the course of four chapters,
will appeal to any reader who is interested in learning about
technology from a beginner’s point of view.

To the best of my knowledge, there are no monographs at the particular
intersections of this book, which explore digital methodologies from
Queer Studies frameworks. Currently, the few works that already exist
with similar focuses are essay collections and individual journal
articles, who use phrases like “Queer DH,” “Queer Data Studies,” and
“Queer Computation” to describe their work. Most relevantly, two
articles by Jacoub Gaboury, including “Critical Unmaking: Toward A
Queer Computation” and “Queer Affects at the Origins of Computation”
align closely with my interventions, with a direct focus on using
Queer Studies as a lens for analyzing digital methods and phenomena.
Additionally, an edited collected by Patrick Keilty, called Queer Data
Studies, offers a variety of “Queer Data” projects in a global
context, ranging from historical and archival work on the history of
sexuality, to more recent methods in machine learning and contemporary
media studies. Its stance, which approaches Queer Data as a
hermeneutic for work that complicates the transparency and legibility
of data, aligns with my own; however, its own limitations as an edited
collections means it cannot offer the kind of sustained attention to
digital tools which is a major focus of Counter-Code. Finally, two
other books, Heavy Processing by T.L. Cowan and Jas Rault, and Queer
Data by Kevin Guyan, are similarly situated at the intersection of
Queer Studies and Digital Studies, although their methodologies differ
sharply from Counter-Code. While Heavy Processing deals with DH
projects, particularly web-based archival projects, its emphasis is on
theoretical methods, what it calls the “proud lesbian feminist
tradition of making a mountain out of a molehill,” rather than digital
work such as building or coding (50). Coming from the Social Sciences,
Queer Data, also has a stark methodological difference from projects
based in the humanities, including my own. Focused on the practical
side of data practices. which looks at data in terms of how to collect
it and its utility for documenting queer life, the book’s orientation
around method differ sharply from the above works and from my own
perspective, which look to problematize, and productively disrupt,
data practices and data objects.

The expected length of the total book is 55k works, spread over four
chapters, an introduction, and a conclusion. In what follows, I offer
a brief summary of each chapter and its contribution to the book as a
whole.

Chapter One, “Text Analysis,” explores text analysis methods to study
gender. I begin with the most basic operation in text analysis, which
is compiling word frequencies through counting words and their
contexts. In order to obtain accurate word counts, however, a text
must first be “cleaned” or standardized, removing idiosyncrasies like
capital letters, inflections, and punctuation. These textual elements,
which can convey subtle identity markers like gender designations, are
removed due to their relative frequency, which can skew the word
counts. I delve into this technical mechanism behind the cleaning
process, called “iteration,” where each word is processed one by one
into a standardized, computable format. Then, I turn to the theory of
gender performativity, from Judith Butler's book, Bodies that Matter:
On the Discursive Limits of 'Sex' (1993). Similarly to text analysis,
gender performativity is based on what Butler calls “iterativity,” a
cyclical operation that repeats the same action again and again. I
then take the iterativity of gender performativity, and its potential
for re-signifying terms, into a new text analysis practice to study
gender forms in Virginia Woolf's novel, Orlando: A Biography (1928).
Despite text analysis processes that diminish peculiarities from
language, I show how one can deploy Butler's understanding of
iteration to open up, rather than collapse, possible associations
between gender terms. I then close the chapter with some recent
critiques of Gender Performativity and its limitations as a discursive
method–a problem which I address more fully in Chapter four.

Moving from text analysis to text encoding, Chapter Two, “Text
Preservation” examines the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), a text
preservation format, to study sexuality. The TEI consists of a set of
electronic standards widely used for tagging, or “encoding,”
text-based data. The structure of the TEI requires that text be sorted
into a rigid, hierarchical format, where inner or “child” elements are
bound and disambiguated within their outer or “parent” element. To
resist this top-down control of the data format, I turn to the
strategy of disidentification, theorized by Queer of Color Critique
scholar José Esteban Muñoz. Disidentification, which is a method for
re-appropriating dominant codes, offers a useful heuristic for
grappling with the rigid boundaries of the TEI. I apply this strategy
to encode the revisions that Oscar Wilde made to his novel, The
Picture of Dorian Gray, prior to its publication in 1890. This
strategy enables me to delineate irreconcilable interpretations of
language choices in Wilde's revision, without knowing or resolving his
ultimate intentions. It is, in other words, a method that surfaces the
contours, but not the content, of what cannot be recovered. I end the
chapter with a meditation on Wilde's own position of privilege as an
editor of his own text, who executed his own censorship. The
privileges of his particular identity position exert a subtle layer of
control in his text, to show that even the most strategic forms of
inclusion are not enough to meaningfully challenge systems of power.

Moving from foundational processes like analyzing and preserving text,
the second half of the book turns to more complex processes of text
display and generation. Chapter Three, “Text Display,” examines the
computing “stack,” the layers of software that transport data from its
storage in the hard drive to the screen display. In order for the
stack to operate efficiently, coding instructions (the program code),
must be separated from its execution, from the moment that the program
“runs.” This environment creates an ontological state of displacement
where electronic activity occurs at a level of remove. This state of
displacement accumulates with each layer of the stack to give the
final illusion that electronic processes are boundless or immaterial
on the screen. To read materiality back into the stack, I draw from
two seemingly unrelated fields, Media Archaeology and Black Feminist
Studies, both of which offer robust methodologies for reading physical
and “fleshy” dimensions of symbolic processes. Thinking across these
theories in parallel, I then embark on a deep reading of two other
seemingly unconnected works, Octavia Butler's science fiction novel,
Dawn (1987), part of the Xenogenesis Trilogy, and an early example of
electronic fiction, skinonskinonskin, by Aureia Harvey and Michaël
Samyn, (1999). These two pieces, one print and another electronic,
both explore the collision of material and immaterial forms in scenes
of sexual desire and intercourse. Reading these works through one
another, I show how program code of the electronic piece,
skinonskinonskin, displays screen effects that, while apparently
disconnected from the underlying computational processing, surfaces a
sense of physical intimacy within the stack.

Building on the concept of “Text Analysis” in chapter one, the fourth
and final chapter explores machine learning to study embodiment. This
chapter, “Text Generation,” traces the steps behind algorithmic
prediction to explore how it transforms word meaning into
computational form, which it argues is a way of normalizing language
use. It explores the training process for Large Language Models
(LLMs), which expresses the meaning of individual words within a
normalized or aggregate form. Within the training process, an LLM
takes various contexts of a word's usage to compile a kind of average
or aggregate use, which it represents through a numerical score called
a “word vector.” I argue that the word vector, which represents
language meaning that has been normalized across various examples, is
an ideal form for studying attachments to norms in language. I then
explore possibilities for studying these attachments in heterosexual,
cisgendered contexts, specifically from the reality TV dating show,
Love is Blind. I choose this show because it’s main gambit, that “love
is blind,” suggests a transgressive premise that undergirds an
ultimately heteronormative teleology: the show, which sequesters
participants from seeing each other in person until they have agreed
to get married, effectively poses the presence of the body as the
determinant of heterosexual apotheosis. Training a model on the
transcripts from the show, so that it generates text in the same
language and style of the show participants, I then pose questions
about the role of the body in their dating experience. The model's
responses reveals linguistic and affective patterns around the body
and touch which characterize normative investments from the show.
Drawing on Trans Studies theorizations of the body and of normativity,
I argue that participants in Love Is Blind–while firmly anchored in
cisnormative frameworks–temporarily experience a temporary form of
bodily dissonance. This experience, though anchored within their
narrow cisgenderd experience, offers grounds for building solidarity
across identity formations and points of view.

As of December 2025, the four main chapters have each been drafted,
and are in the process of undergoing revision. The introduction and
the conclusion remain to be drafted.

Thank you for your consideration.

*** book narrative draft

This book explores computational processes that work with language. It
applies concepts from Queer Studies and related fields to push against
the ways that computational processes reduce and flatten the
complexity of language data. It shows how certain computational tasks,
like text analysis, tend to constrain the expressive potential of
language forms, stripping them of idiosyncrasies and ambiguities, to
turn them into computable units of data. Humanities fields like Queer
Studies, Black Feminist Studies, and Trans Studies inspire
methodologies for working against these constraints—methodologies that
destabilize authoritative and delimiting structures and open novel
readings of language data. In its experiment with these methodologies,
Counter-Code uses examples of Queer literature as test cases, applying
methods to elements of gender, sexuality, and sex in computational
structures and processes. By engaging closely with these computational
processes, and learning how they work under the hood, the reader will
discover tools for resisting the ways that technology constrains and
determines language meaning.

Each chapter of this book takes up a computational process for working
with text and uses that process to study a component of queer identity
expressed in a sample of Queer Literature. Within each computational
process, the chapter identifies a constraint--a mechanism that
transforms and reduces a component of queer identity into computable
data. The earlier chapters focus on basic processes, like counting and
tagging language data, to study gender and sexuality, while the later
chapters move toward more complex processes of visual display and
algorithmic prediction to explore sexed materiality and embodiment.
Chapter one, "Text Analysis," uses text analysis to study gender in
Virginia Woolf's /Orlando: A Biography/. Chapter two, "Text
Preservation," turns to text preservation methods to trace the
suppression of homosexuality in Oscar Wilde's novel, /The Picture of
Dorian Gray/. Then, the third chapter "Text Display," reads examples
of sensuality and physicality acrosss print and electronic formats, in
Octavia Butler's novel, /Dawn/, and a work of electronic literature,
entitled /skinonskinonskin/, by the net artist, /Entropy8Zuper!/.
Finally, the fourth chapter, "Text Generation," experiments with
algorithmic prediction to analyze gendered embodiment in a reality TV
dating show, /Love is Blind/. Moving from canonical works of Queer
Literature and Queer Studies in its early chapters to more eclectic
source material, like science fiction and reality TV in the latter
chapters, this book expands the repertoire of "Queer" beyond its
institutional use.

The book also asks how Queer Studies as a field might inspire the
critique and re-vision of technological systems. Queer Studies offers
powerful methodologies for disrupting existing structures of
meaning-making, such as gender performativity and disidentification,
the theories that drive the arguments in the book's first two
chapters. Drawing from these theories, these chapterrs propose
strategies for resistance that work against totalizing structures from
the inside, so to speak. However, other fields, like Black Feminist
Studies and Trans Studies, offer methods that are outside of or beside
such structures. These methods ground meaning in material realities
and lived embodiment, prioritizing intersectionality and solidarity
within new imaginaries. Drawing from these adjacent fields, the
chapters in the second half of the book thus respond to the threads
spun in the first half, bringing both critique and imaginative work to
the goal of re-visioning technological systems. Developing queer for
the future, the book argues, involves collaborating across adjacent
fields to compile a strategic and flexible set of methodological
tools.

Chapter One, "Text Analysis," explores text analysis methods to study
gender. I begin with the most basic operation in text analysis, which
is compiling word freqencies through counting words and their
contexts. In order to obtain accurate word counts, however, a text
must first be "cleaned" or standardized, removing idiosynracies like
capital letters, inflections, and punctuation. These textual elements,
which can convey subtle identity markers like gender designations, are
removed due to their relative frequency, which can skew the word
counts. I delve into this technical mechanism behind the cleaning
process, called "iteration," where each word is procssed one by one
into a standardized, computable format. Then, I turn to the theory of
gender performativity, from Judith Butler's book, /Bodies that Matter:
On the Discursive Limits of 'Sex'/ (1993). Similarly to text analysis,
gender performativity is based on what Butler calls "iterativity," a
cyclical operation that repeats the same action again and again. I
then take the iterativity of gender performativity, and its potential
for re-signifying terms, into a new text analysis pratice to study
gender forms in Virginia Woolf's novel, /Orlando: A Biography/ (1928).
Despite text analysis processes that diminish peculiarities from
language, I show how one can deploy Butler's understanding of
iteration to open up, rather than collapse, possible associations
between gender terms. I then close the chapter with some recent
critiques of Gender Performativity and its limitations as a discursive
method--a problem which I address more fully in Chapter four.

Moving from text analysis to text encoding, Chapter Two, "Text
Preservation" examines the Text Encoding Initative (TEI), a text
preservation format, to study sexuality. The TEI consists of a set of
electronic standards widely used for tagging, or "encoding,"
text-based data. The structure of the TEI requires that text be sorted
into a rigid, hierarchical format, where inner or "child" elements are
bound and disambiguated within their outer or "parent" element. To
resist this top-down control of the data format, I turn to the
strategy of disidentification, theorized by Queer of Color Critique
scholar José Esteban Muñoz. Disidentification, which is a method for
re-appropriating dominant codes, offers a useful heuristic for
grappling with the rigid boundaries of the TEI. I apply this strategy
to encode the revisions that Oscar Wilde made to his novel, /The
Picture of Dorian Gray/, prior to its publication in 1890. This
strategy enables me delineate irreconcilable interpretations of
language choices in Wilde's revision, without knowing or resolving
this ultimate intentions. It is, in other words, a method that
surfaces the contours, but not the content, of what cannot be
recovered. I end the chapter with a meditation on Wilde's own position
of privilege as an editor of his own text, who executed his own
censorship. The privileges of his particular identity position exert a
subtle layer of control in his text, to show that even the most
strategic forms of inclusion are not enough to meaningfully challenge
systems of power.

Moving from foundational processes like analyzing and preserving text,
the second half of the book turns to more complex processes of text
display and generation. Chapter Three, "Text Display," examines the
computing "stack," the layers of software that transport data from its
storage in the hard drive to the screen display. In order for the
stack to operate efficiently, coding instructions (the program code),
must be separated from its execution, from the moment that the program
"runs." This environment creates an ontological state of displacement
where electronic activity occurs at a level of remove. This state of
displacement accumulates with each layer of the stack to give the
final illusion that electronic processes are boundless or immaterial
on the screen. To read materiality back into the stack, I draw from
two seemingly unrelated fields, Media Archaeology and Black Feminist
Studies, both of which offer robust methodologies for reading physical
and "fleshy" dimensions of symbolic processes. Thinking across these
theories in parallel, I then embark on a deep reading of two other
seemingly unconnected works, Octavia Butler's science fiction novel,
/Dawn/ (1987), part of the /Xenogenesis Triology/, and an early
example of electronic fiction, /skinonskinonskin/, by Aureia Harvey
and Michaël Samyn, (1999). These two pieces, one print and another
electronic, both explore the collision of material and immaterial
forms in scenes of sexual desire and intercourse. Reading these works
through one another, I show how program code of the electronic piece,
/skinonskinonskin/, displays screen effects that, while apparently
disconnected from the underlying computational processing, surfaces a
sense of physical intimacy within the stack.

Building on the concept of "Text Analysis" in chapter one, the fourth
and final chapter explores machine learning to study embodiment. This
chapter, "Text Generation," traces the steps behind algorithmic
prediction to explore how it transforms word meaning into
computational form, which it argues is a way of /normalizing/ language
use. It explores the training process for Large Language Models
(LLMs), which expresses the meaning of individual words within a
normalized or aggregate form. Within the training process, an LLM
takes various contexts of a word's usage to compile a kind of average
or aggregate use, which it represents through a numerical score called
a "word vector." I argue that the word vector, which represents
language meaning that has been normalized across various examples, is
an ideal form for studying attachments to norms in language. I then
explore possibilities for studying these attachments in heterosexual,
cisgendered contexts, specifically from the reality TV dating show,
/Love is Blind/. I choose this show because it’s main gambit, that
"love is blind," suggests a transgressive premise that undergirds an
ultimately heteronormative teleology: the show, which sequesters
participants from seeing each other in person until they have agreed
to get married, effectively poses the presence of the body as the
determinant of heterosexual apotheosis. Training a model on the
trainscripts from the show, so that it generates text in the same
language and style of the show participants, I then pose questions
about the role of the body in their dating experience. The model's
responses reveals linguistic and affective patterns around the body
and touch which characterize normative investments from the show.
Drawing on Trans Studies theorizations of the body and of normativity,
I argue that participants in /Love Is Blind/--while firmly anchored in
cisnormative frameworks--temporarily experience a temporary form of
bodily dissonanc. This experience, though anchored within their narrow
cisgenderd experience, offers grounds for building solidarity across
identity formations and points of view.
