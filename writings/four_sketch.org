*** questions
Are there, could there be, any way of surfacing body narratives in
heterosexual, cisgendered stories?

How might these investments connect the anti-trans and trans
perspectives?

Machine learning ideal tool for studying normativity: a tool for
finding the shared, the average, the obvious.

Close reading analysis:
- Question -- how does the presence of the visual body affect dating?
- Answer -- body perception splits, bodily sensation flows and ebbs.

*** bank
Over 25 years ago, in response to lack of government response to the
AIDS crisis, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick questions the point of knowledge
pratices like critique. She asks, "What does knowledge do---the
pursuit of it, the having and expressing of it?" (124). In a moment of
incontrovertible evidence of government disregard (if not disdain) for
those affected by the AIDS crisis, primarily Black and gay lives,
Sedgwick wonders about the point of doing critique in the first place.
It seems that, at that moment in time, no level of exposure or
demystification would "enjoin on [...] persons to any specific train
of epistemological or narrative consequences" (123).

One could apply this question to our political sitatuation now, with
more than enough evidence documenting the level of neglect of and
contempt for trans people in the US. Furthermore, the technological
evolution puts all the damning evidence at our fingertips, to amplify
the message to what is, for many of us, anxiety-inducing levels.

This paper proposes a reading practice that responds to this
particular political and technological moment of information overload
and impotence, and it explores one possibility for what we might do
with it. It seeks out, like Sedgwick did decades ago, a way of reading
that surfaces connections in places where they are unexpected.

Despite being cisgendered, then, body image can have a material force
in an environment where the integrity bodily perception is disrupted.
The sensation of the body feeling "real" and like it's "coming off"
speak to this process of fragmentation, a process that is so visceral
so that, as Prosser explains, "feeling like... can be experienced as a
core self" (79).

This is how it builds a sense of the meaning associated with each
word,

So that the that the model "learns" how characters talk about certain
topics like love, desire, and the body.

This paper is about normativity, and how the desire for normativity
can connect even the most polarized subjects and experiences.

Participants enter /Love Is Blind/ with one goal: to find their ideal
partner and get married. However, the show's main gambit is that the
participants cannot see each other; they must date from behind a wall,
with only access to the other's voice. Once they have agreed to get
married, then they are allowed to meet their intended in person. And
usually, that is when things start to go south.

**** what does LiB have to do with trans studies? 
Strictly speaking, I do not align with the identity qualities that
determine belonging in either of the groups that I am concerning
myself with in this essay. As a cis lesbian, who is not trans, and who
is not straight, where do I come off making a case about using Trans
Studies theory to read the dynamics of heterosexual relationships? I
could say that queerness puts me into a kind of solidarity/intimacy
with trans subjects, or even that my sexuality is intimately linked to
my more masc presentation. But that is as true as it would be to say
that I experience a foundational connection to cis subjects through
the shared identification with my assignment at birth---which is
false.

**** trans studies on normativity, body splits, future fatigue
To explore the desire for normativity, I borrow from ideas in Trans
Studies. Andrea Long Chu points out that Trans Studies "requires that
we understand–-as we never have before–-what it means to be attached
to a norm, by desire, by habit, by survival" ("After Trans Studies"
108).

Specifically, I borrow from ideas about the body. I am interested in
how the body figures into trajectories of normativity, which, in the
case of the cis-hetero subjects in /LiB/, is about the trajectory
toward getting married.



And that this experience tells us a lot about what normativity, how
the desire for normative markers, works in perhaps unexpected
intra-social ways (that it creates envy and animosity among cis
groups?). The experience for cis subjects in the pods creates
expectations and disappointments that are actually shared across
identity groups.

**** word vectors
First, I feed examples of text culled from the show's transcripts into
.  It then uses these patterns
from the text to make educated guesses on how to respond to questions
about the body and its role in the couples' romantic plot. This
process, which is highly techical (and explained in detail below),
allows me to surface common perspectives and experiences from the
characters on the show. It is a tool for normalizing language
expression into average forms.

I use computational tools, which translate word semantics into
numerical representations, that can then be converted into averages
(explained in technical detail below). I then generate the most
average expressions based on this text, expressions that explore
concepts of embodiment and desire and how they influence normativity.

I choose this computational method because it is an ideal one for
studying what words and phrases mean base on the context that they are
being used. This method, which is machine learning, aggregates word
meaning from various examples of usage. For my project, these examples
come from the transcripts of the show itself, which I feed into a
machine learning algorithm. This algorithm "learns" what words mean in
context. It's goal is build a strong enough model of word meaning so
it can then make accurate predictions of what words tend to be used
together in a sentence.

There are some technical concepts that are essential to understanding
how this predictive process works. 

First, one must understand how language is represented in numerical
forms, which are called word vectors. Word vectors are how a machine
learning knows what words mean individually, they comprise the model's
internal dictionary, so to speak. Drawing from the concept of "vector"
in math, which describes coordinates for a line in graphical space,
word vector consists of numbers, a long list of numbers. For example,
below is the word vector for the word "queen":

#+begin_quote
'queen': -0.3583, -0.6767, 0.1689, -0.6164, -0.0135, -0.2284, 0.3359,
        0.1149, -0.1512, -0.8014
#+end_quote

Each of these numbers following "queen" (e.g. .3583, -0.6767, 0.1689,
and so on) represents the relationship between queen and another word,
like "woman" or "orange." Each of those numbers represents this
relationship as a probability score, a percentage that indicates how
closely those two words are associated with each other. In this
database, the words "Queen" and "woman" would likely have a high
probability association, due to their both being associated with
humans and femininity, while "woman" and "orange" may have a much
lower probability. Therefore, in vector space, the multi-dimensional
space where the words are plotted as lines, the coordinates that
represent "woman" would be nearby the coordinates that represent
"Queen," and farther from the coordinates that represent "orange."

Vectors transform what we think of as word meaning by quantifying it
into a numerical representation. And the idea is that once word
meaning is quantified, it can be calculated. The matrix format of the
word vector enables a host of mathematical operations and algorithms:
from example, cosine similarity calculates the distance between two
vectors, that is, two words; and regression analysis guesses the
relationship between an independant and dependant variable, or
relation between one word and another.

Word meaning, significantly, can be calcuated via a formula. That's
what the authors argue, anyway, in the paper that introduced word
vectors to the world, titled "Efficient Estimation of Word
Representations in Vector Space" (Mikolov et al. 2013). To illustrate
the power of word vectors, the authors offer calculate the vector
"queen" by subtracting "man" from "king" and adding "woman."[fn:1]

#+begin_src
  vector(”King”) - vector(”Man”) + vector(”Woman”) = vector("Queen")
#+end_src

This example was presumably chosen for its intelligibility, based on
operands whose differences are assumed to be stable across cultures.
To get "queen", one need only add "woman" to "king", and from the
resulting sum, subtract "man." The meaning of each term appears to be
self-evident and universally true; it is stabilized by the equals sign
that balances the formula. That readers know what a "man" and "woman"
are, just as they know what a "king" and "queen" is, speaks to how
assumptions of gender are implicated within those of patriarchy and
imperialism.[fn:2]

**** training process

In the first step, the "hypothesis" step, a model will randomly guess
what words are associated with each other---it will make a hypothesis.
In doing so, it takes a sample sentence from the transcript, like
"Love is blind," and it blocks out the second half of the sentence, so
that "Love is" remains. Then, it tries to guess which word or phrase
should go in that blank. Because the model has no idea what the words
mean, the guess will be wrong. But that's doesn't matter, because the
purpose of the hypothesis is to make any guess, so that it has
something from which it build in the future steps.

After making this guess, it moves to the next step, where the machine
checks its prediction against the actual example. Because the guess
will be inevitably wrong, there will always be a difference between
the prediction and the actual result. And it will calculate the
difference between the prediction and the actual example, which is
called the "loss."

From this difference, this "loss," it starts to build a sense of
contexts associated with each word, keeping track of which words tend
to appear with each other in context. Each time that the model makes a
subsequent guess, it updates its internal representation of the word
to reflect its association (or lack of association) to certain words.
In technical terms, this internal representation of the word is called
its "word vector," called so because it contains a long lists of
numbers, the "vector," which represents the word's meaning to the
model.

In the third step, it moves to the minimizing this "loss" by /very
slightly/ adjusting the contents of the word vector. The model will do
this many times, so progress is very slow, but also very precise. It
will make guess after guess, trying out many words, perhaps every word
in the dataset, until it finds those which are most likely to appear
together. This constant iteration, and the computer processing
required to do it, is why language models take lots of time, energy,
and computer hardware to train. At each round of training, the vector
attached to each words is slightly adjusted toward what is effectively
a vector that accurately represents that words' relationship to every
other word in the database.

*** transcripts bank
**** postpods: touch is my worst nightmare
Looking at the transcripts, touch is associated with revulsion. In
this example, the couple Paul and Micah encounter some fish in the
ocean. 

Much more negative than the touch happening in the pods. 

**** no sex
In the context of the show, these outputs make sense because physical
intimacy begins to plague most the couples as soon as they meet. As
they move from the pods to living together, they struggle to progress
their relationships into physical contact, a fact that is mostly kept
unacknowledged until there is breakup.
**** THE FUTURE BECOMES BLEAK
***** in pods, excitement for union/commitment
PODS
- I'm excited to spend my first night with her.
- I am so excited to spend the rest of my life with you.

POSTPODS
- I think that, like, we can work through it and, like, move it to
  where we need it to be.
- I don't want you to get hurt.

***** future is postive, becomes negative/bleak
In pods, the future is positive:
- The future with you, it's gonna be tenfold.
- The future togetherness is gonna be great.
- The future with her, she's gonna be there forever.

Postpods, the future is more negative:
- The future looks pretty bleak. (repeated)
- The future has been absolutely horrible.

**** BODY EMBODIED -> MULTI-SENSORY / IDEALIZED
***** DONE in pods, being loved on the inside 
CLOSED: [2025-10-02 Thu 14:06]
PODS
- I want someone who is gonna have the most authentic relationship and the most authentic connection with me.
- I want someone who will love me regardless of how I look, not my bad breath.

***** DONE in pods, body is more embodied, becomes visual
CLOSED: [2025-10-02 Thu 14:38]
Like a second skin, like a weight: heavier, reality, different, torn,
but also like an open mind, going all over my mind.

  aggressive.

***** touching goes from feeling good to multi-sensory, emotional feelings
When close reading the examples of "touch", in PODS they are all
positive and forward looking; and in POSTPODS they are mostly negative
and describe revulsion.

In the LLM, in the pods, touch is brought to the present and is
positive, and for the postpods, touch expands to different senses.

- "want" - changes from pods to postpods -- becomes displaced into the
  other, where before was focused on subjectivity, the self.
  - perhaps desire goes away because it become projected onto the
    other.
- "having sex" - in the pods, it's a "thing"; while in the postpods,
  it's "a big issue", "big deal", "scary", "tough". 
  - moves from a concept invested with importance to a problem.
- "he is / she is" - have similar predicates.
  - genders are interchangeable.
  - not yet specific.
- "afraid"
  - more variety in postpod episodes; focused on fear of the future,
    of relationships not working out.

***** family/kids are projection & normative, become cynical, resisting control and commitment
PODS
- I want to have kids by myself.

When prompted with the input phrase, "I want," many of the responses
emphasize family roles, kids, and being loved beyond appearances.  

Sentences like, "I want to be a father figure for my kids," and "I
want my mom to have grandchildren," and "I want someone who wants to
be a dad, and I want someone who wants to be a grandfather." These
sentences emphasize roles that are desirable not just for the subject
themself, "to be a father figure," but also for others in the family
structure: for a partner to "be a dad," for a mom "to have
grandchilren." The desire to have children is also linked to the
parents' desire: "I want kids like my parents did," and "I want kids
like my dad did with me." Children are desirable not only for
reproducing the family structure but also for solidify roles
within it.

There is a concern with giving "kids" the same or better life that one
has. In some examples, the concern is more explicity with markers of
social mobility: "I want kids to be able to go to college, and to
graduate college"; "I want kids to be able to go to college, to become
successful, and to have successful families"; and "I want kids to be
able to have that, you know."

There is a point when the desire for the kids' wellbeing appears to
blend into the parents' desire. An example like, "I want kids to be
like, 'I'm gonna follow my heart,'" appears to mean that the kids
should follow their heart, while ones like "I want kids to be able to
make the most important decision of their lives," seems to be a
reflection of not the kid's desire but that of the speaker, who in the
course of the show will be making the most important decision of his
life.

But "kids" not only refers to the desire of the speaking subject, it
can also stand in for that of the romantic object. This slippage
creates the nonsensical sentence, "I want my kids to have a future
together where we can just see it and be like, 'Oh, I'm not picking
the right kids.'" Here, references to having "a future together" and
"picking the right kids" likely refer to the potential partner. This
slippage between the kids and the partner leads to a humorous
conclusion: that the kids are not the right choice.

Although the sentence is humorous, I suggest that the interpretation
ought to be quite literal. To the machine, the predicted sentence is
the most likely outcome, based on its training from the show's
transcripts. This slippage between "kids" and the romantic couple
means that very likely, in the word vector database, the vectors for
"kids" is closely associated with that of the romantic couple. To the
machine, then, the kids significantly stand in for the self and for
the couple, which naturally leads to the outcome that choosing a
partner is also a way of choosing the kids. Other sentences suggest a
similar explanation: "I don't want kids falling in love with me
because they don't know what I'm doing"; "I want kids to know that I
love them, and I want them to know that I'm still going through this";
"I don't want kids to feel pressure."

This effect is more dramatized from the episodes that follow the pods,
where references to "kids" take on noticeably darker outcomes: "I
don't want kids to feel like... like they're being controlled," "I
don't want kids like that to come into my life," and "I don't want
kids to feel like... they're not ready for marriage."

An article about the shared investments across between pro- and
anti-trans perspectives. Using ML to explore this.

One problem:
- pro-trans groups say that gender is subjective, based on perception,
  not on body.
- anti-trans groups say that if gender is subjective, then there is no
  need to bring the body into alignment.
- subjectivity is not a good argument for trans rights advocacy. It
  neglects the body (Amin) and reinforces late-stage capitalism
  (Gould).

Another problem: what do trans and cis people share? 

Approach: Machine Learning analysis
- What do these two sides have in common? What investments do they
  have in common?
- Using machine learning tools, which are really good at finding what
  is shared, approximating, to surface their shared investments.
- Doing a Trans Studies analysis of a very straight reality TV show,
  Love Is Blind.

Frameworks:
- Chu's trans subjects explore what it means to be "attached" to
  norms.
  - Trans people want "a normal fucking life." “Desire for the norm
    persists through nonnormative attempts at
  normativity” (107).
- Prosser's arguments about desire for heteronormativity.
- Bey's argument for gender abolition, nonrecognition, uncaptured, a
  way of being out of the taxonomy (Amin).
  - Builds on strands of queer theory that resist categorization. 

Connecting to debates in Trans Studies about the desire for
normativity and passing in trans subjects. Looking at how the desire
for normativity can be a through line between trans subjects and
anti-trans groups. If we can find some kind of connection, solidarity,
then could we bridge the gaps of hate and fear of the unknown?

*** some theory:
Malatino - negative feelings are a means of intra-trans relation.
Arguing for the political efficacy of negative feelings. (Need to get
the specific argument/possibilities here).

Love - bad feelings don't lead us anywhere. Sometimes we should just
stay with them, regress with them. We do not have to progress, to get
better. Sometimes we cannot. 

Chun - Homophily: Negative feelings are a tool of polarization, a way
of aligning people around a cause, but in a way that also keeps them
separate. For example, incels. Explained via magnetic polarization:
"polarized filings both repel one another and stick together through
their overwhelming attraction to their opposite pole" (Chun 85).

  - "This form of trans politics—that may be described as ‘trans

    problems facing trans people, and will enable our participation in
    (Western) capitalist society; that, alongside rights, positive

Transphobia indicates a rational fear, "grounded in a larger cisgender
social context", which is structural and difficult to parcel out:
- "Provisionally, the term can be defined to mean any negative
  attitudes (hate, contempt, disapproval) directed toward trans people
  because of their being trans. When taken literally, the word means a
  kind of fear. But like homophobia (on which the word is modeled), it
  is used more broadly. And while transphobia suggests an analogy with
  terms like agoraphobia and therefore implies irrationality
  (Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary defines homophobia as “an
  irrational fear of, aversion to, or discrimination against
  homosexuality or homosexuals”1; most dictionaries do not define
  transphobia at all), this implication ought to be rejected.
  Transphobia occurs in a broader social context that systematically
  disadvantages trans people and promotes and rewards antitrans
  sentiment. It therefore has a kind of rationality to it, grounded in
  a larger cisgenderist social context (Hopkins 1996)." (Bettcher
  249).
- "A trans woman might be targeted not because of her trans status
  but because she is simply viewed as a sex worker (Namaste 2005).
  Moreover, at least in some cases, transphobia may be inseparably
  blended with misogyny or racism in ways that challenge a single-axis
  model of power (Juang 2006). Such inseparabilities undermine the
  attempt to account for transphobia in a way that excludes or
  marginalizes considerations of sexism, racism, classism, ableism,
  and so forth. This consideration is important because it questions
  why certain instances of violence should be characterized as
  instances of transphobia (as opposed to instances of racism or
  sexism) in the first place and what the underlying political agenda
  sustaining such characterization is. My conclusion, at any rate, is
  that while we might have a definition of transphobia, the term is
  not much more than a convenient (and not altogether innocent)
  placeholder for the real intellectual work that remains to be done."

**** Amin, Kadji. “Taxonomically Queer? Sexology and New Queer, Trans, and Asexual Identities.” GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies, vol. 29, no. 1, 2023, pp. 91–107.

About how we categorize gender.

We've moved from a heterosexual matrix to a kaleidoscope, "in which
each axis of definition is mobile and may be combined with any other
axis, making way for an almost infinite array of variations" (Amin,
"Taxonomically" 91).

The "a nuanced and nimble vocabulary through which to know, define,
and communicate their own unique gender and sexual subjectivity," a
taxonomy, goes against queerness and Queer and Trans Theory, and
participates in racial and sexological logics. 
- "what could be further from the queer — which might be glossed as a
  deconstructive method of troubling categorizations — than taxonomy,
  a scientific method of establishing them?" (Amin, "Taxonomically"
  92).
- "contemporary queer systems of identity are the latest iteration of
  the classificatory logics behind sexology in particular and racial
  science more generally" (Amin, "Taxonomically" 92).
- "How are the scholarly fields of queer and trans studies — which
  have taken shape in ambivalent resistance to sexology and taxonomy
  alike — to contend with the departure of the cultures to which they
  owe their existence from this basic orientation?" (Amin,
  "Taxonomically" 93).

History of taxonomization
- "the distinction between gender and sexuality was always a
  sexological invention — a taxonomical principle masquerading as an
  ontological distinction" (Amin, "Taxonomically" 92).

Taxonomy a tactic of white supremacy:
- "As damaging as sexological taxonomies have been for many gender and
  sexual deviants, to be sexologically diagnosable in the first place
  was a white distinction — a testament to the individuality,
  complexity, and value of white bodies and psyches. As many scholars
  have demonstrated, Indigenous and racialized peoples were not
  considered deviant as sexological individuals who might be
  homosexuals, sadists, sexual fetishists, etc., but rather en masse,
  as constitutively and polymorphously perverse populations (Ross
  2005; Driskill 2016)." (Amin, "Taxonomically" 95).

Can taxonomy be queered? According to Love?
- "In light of this noxious history, is it even conceivable to put a
  queer spin on taxonomy? This question dovetails with methodological
  debates in queer studies that ask if scientific and social
  scientific methods that have been part of the objectification of the
  world in ways organized around anti-Blackness, colonial conquest,
  and the pathologization of deviance can be repurposed for more
  innocent or even progressive ends or whether such methods inevitably
  perpetuate the hierarchical, violent, and racist epistemological
  frameworks from which they emerged (Love 2015; Ghaziani and Brim
  2019). We might locate the contemporary queer, trans, and asexual
  taxonomical renaissance as a crucial case study within this debate."
  (Amin, "Taxonomically" 96).

Taxonomy has epistemological assumptions, significantly, that
identities are essential, and dovetail with current ideas of gender
being biologically rooted. 
- "Taxonomy’s biological inheritance brings with it the conceit that
  taxonomical categories and divisions are objective and innate, the
  hidden laws that govern what manifests in the natural world. This is
  the foundational premise of Hirschfeld’s taxonomy: that everything —
  from choice of hobbies, to aptitude for a certain profession, to
  gait, to taste in undergarments, to preference for certain sex acts,
  to attraction to cavalrymen — is ultimately biologically determined,
  albeit according to sexed elements that are far more complex and
  variable than mere binary genital anatomy. Despite the ethos of
  self-identification and rejection of outside (or insider) experts
  classifying individuals according to “objective” criteria, new queer
  taxonomies end up dovetailing, sometimes intentionally (Chasin
  2013), with popular and medical beliefs that sexual and gender
  identities are biologically rooted, innate, unchanging, and discrete
  from one another. This, in turn, reinforces damaging, exclusionary,
  and grossly oversimplified criteria about who counts as, for
  instance, a “true” transsexual or authentic asexual. Indeed, the
  vernacular thirst to taxonomize partakes of a scientism that
  animates faith in taxonomy as a significant and meaningful method in
  the first place." (Amin, "Taxonomically" 100).
- "New spins on taxonomy risk installing a new universalism that
  downgrades competing epistemologies to the status of the local, the
  backward, the traditional, or the false conflation." (Amin,
  "Taxonomically" 101).


Dis-identification as a strategy for working within these taxonomies
- "I want to acknowledge the creative and resourceful ways in which
  Indigenous and racialized people “dis-identify” with these
  categories, creatively reworking them and exposing their normative
  operations from within (Muñoz 1999). Such disidentificatory
  performances occur every time an Indigenous or racialized person
  lays claim to one of these categories while calling attention to the
  fact that theirs are usually not the bodies evoked by this category,
  and even that, racially speaking, they may not have access to
  cisgender binaries or ideals about “healthy” levels of sexual desire
  in the first place" (Amin, "Taxonomically" 103).


Dis-identification as a strategy for working within these taxonomies

"Whether or not scholars critique it, however, the queer taxonomical
imaginary is likely here to stay. I, for one, find the growing
bifurcation of queer, trans, and asexual scholarly analytics from
queer, trans, and asexual practices of living frankly unethical. My
proposal, then, is threefold. First, “deidealize” queerness by
recognizing that taxonomy can be queer, in the sense of being useful
and meaningful to queer-identified people (Amin 2017). This approach
requires cultivating scholarly sympathy and empirical curiosity about
the identifications, erotics, relations, and life-ways opened up by
new, queer, trans, and asexual taxonomies. Second, continually center
those Indigenous, non-Western, and historical ontologies of being that
new taxonomies — with their universalist scientific trappings —
threaten to erase, incorporate, [End Page 104] and/or supersede.
Finally, fuck with the universalizing presumptions of the taxonomical
method from within by generating idiosyncratic interpretations and
translations that explode the epistemological and ontological
foundations of taxonomy itself. That, I think, would be an ethical
scholarly approach to new queer, trans, and asexual taxonomies."

*** cutouts from previous drafts

**** amin on divergence model leaving out gender as expression
The development of the gender identification has, according to Queer
and Trans Studies scholar Kadji Amin, created a domino effect where
gender is increasingly idealized and divorced from bodily expression.
Amin argues that identity terms often used within transgender
discourse, particularly the terms "cisgender" and "nonbinary," reflect
an idealized conceptualizations that actually re-stigmatize
non-normative gender expressions.

One significant effect of the categories is that they create idealized
forms of normativity that do not accurately describe any
gender-sexuality in lived reality. This is because normative
categories like "heterosexual" and "cisgender" form as a reaction to
the emergence of non-normative identities. Amin explains that, rather
than descriptive categories, the terms heterosexual, cisgender, and
binary represent fictions, "increasingly idealized and uninhabitable
normative categories," created to balance the non-normative identities
of homosexual, transgender, and nonbinary [Amin 116].

As a reaction to non-normative categories, the normative categories of
"heterosexual," "cisgender," and "binary" imply idealized notions of
gender-sexuality that are difficult to inhabit because there is not
inner feeling of identification. This lack of identificatory feeling
explains why, for example, many apparently cisgender people find it
difficult to identify with the "cisgender" and "binary" nominatives.
While it is relatively simple to name the experience of discomfort in
one's embodied gender-sexuality as gender dysphoria, it is less
straightforward to name and describe the experience of what is
unremarkable, routine, and even banal. There is no salient feeling
that describe the experience of being comfortable in one's
gender-sexuality.

As it increasingly diverges in categories, Amin argues, gender
identity becomes buried "deeper and deeper within the private recesses
of the self, where it increasingly disavows any relation to the
social" [Amin 116]. In other words, idealized categories like
cisgender and nonbinary make non-normative gender identities less and
less visible. For example, in the identity of the "femme" (feminine)
presenting nonbinary person describes a woman assigned with a feminine
gender expression that nonetheless identifies as nonbinary.

The effect of prioritizing non-normative gender as an /identity/ that
is invisible, that is not immediately apparent despite being marked,
is to marginalize gender as /expression/, which re-stigmatizes those
gender groups that already experience social stigma. Amin points to
feminized genders to make this point--the queen and the fairy, for
instance. Defining gender as an external expression or embodiment is
more likely to make visible and validate those gender which experience
stigamtization based precisely on how those genders present outwardly. 


**** close reading ACLU & Heritage
To explore this question, I'm going to show a few examples from my
current research, which uses ML tools for the purpose of studying
discriminatory and prejudiced language. For this, I scrape data from
various internet sources, which represent different perspectives.
Then, I use this data to train (very small) ML models, to see how they
respond to certain prompts.

The goal here is not to generate text for the sake of generating text,
but to surface certain insights about the data on which that text was
trained.

I'm going to show some examples of ML-generated text based on two very
different data sources, representing different political perspectives
on the topic of transgender rights in the US.

    SLIDE heritage screenshot

One of these sources represents an American conservative perspective,
and comes from the Heritage Foundation, which is a think-tank in
Washington DC whose goal is to influence governmental policy. You can
see some of the headlines here from their website, like "Sorry
Democrats, but Trumps' 'Two Sexes' Executive Order is Constitutional".
All of these articles, about 300 in total, were included in my
dataset. 

    SLIDE ACLU trans screenshot

Coming from the opposing side, from the progressive pole, is the ACLU,
the American Civil Liberties Union, which is a group of legal
professionals and volunteers who advocate on behalf of civil rights
for marginalized groups in the US. Here, you'll see articles that
speak of trans in terms of "rights" and "liberation," and connect it
to LGB rights more broadly.

With these datasets, I then trained two individual large language
models, using gpt-2 (an open source model) as the base model. I'll
mention quickly, for those who don't know, that training models
happens in various stages. What I did was take an already trained
model, gpt2, and re-trained it on a smaller and more specific dataset.
This is technically called "fine-tuning", and its much easier and less
resource intensive than training the underlying "base" model (I am
more than happy to explain more details in the Q&A).

So, after training, I fed a series of prompts to both of the resulting
models.

These prompts included:

    SLIDE prompts

#+begin_quote
Masculinity is

Femininity is

Transgender is

Gender binary is

Man is

Woman is
#+end_quote

And finally, I comapared the results.

First, there was a strong contrast of gender and how genders are
conceptualized between the model trained on the ACLU data and model
trained on the Heritage data. First, I'll show some examples from the
ACLU model, which represents the progressive side:

#+begin_quote
Masculinity is a matter of love and celebration.

Masculinity is a space for hope and liberation for all.

Masculinity is not defined solely by the beauty of our bodies, but by
the beauty of our experiences.

Femininity is a celebration of beauty, feminine liberation, and
femininity.

Femininity is our joy, our struggle, and our fight is our struggle.

Femininity is about allowing people to express themselves without
government interference.
#+end_quote

As you can see, terms associated with "masculinity" and "femininity"
are characterized by gender-affirming, even celebratory language,
which is very positive and empowering; using words like "liberation,"
"beauty", and "joy". Reading this, you get the sense that these terms
come from contexts mentioning transgender experiences, and in the
training data, "masculinity" and "femininity" may have been prepended
by the term "trans."

From these examples, you may also notice the tendency of language
models (especially very small and underdeveloped ones) to repeat
themselves. This is a quirk due to their predictive nature, where the
goal is to guess the next word based on what is most likely. As a
result, they get themselves stuck into these little loops of saying
the same thing over and over again---which I find kind of endearing.

Now, I'll show the text generated by the model trained on the Heritage
Foundation data.

#+begin_quote
Masculinity is the cornerstone of Western civilization.

Masculinity is the fruit of patriarchy, and patriarchy is the heart
of conservatism.

Masculinity is defined by the ability to produce sperm, eggs, and live
children.

Femininity is an enduring American tradition.

Femininity is defined by means of the relationship between the sexes,
the ability to raise their children, the capacity to provide for their
own reproduction, the capacity to provide for their own children, the
ability to provide for their own.
#+end_quote

Here, these gender terms are also positive, but their associations
with culture, tradition, and reproduction---things that suggest
stability rather than empowerment.

So you can see, even from just glancing at the results, that there are
direct connections between the training data and the model outputs. By
processing the training data, the model learned not just how language
works, the "facts or rules" of language, but absorbed the perspectives
contained within that language. So that, depending on the dataset that
the model is trained on, the terms "masculinity" and "femininity" will
have totally different meanings.

Perhaps this is not surprising. But what I also found, which deepens
this a little bit, is that gendered terms reveal investments in other,
seemingly unrelated or benign terms.

    SLIDE subjective

For example, the Heritage Foundation model kept repeating the term
"subjectivity" when it mentions gender:

#+begin_quote
Masculinity is a subjective self-perception, not a universal
concept.

Femininity is a subjective, internal sense of self.

The gender binary is a subjective, malleable, and often incorrect
idea.

The gender binary is a subjective, internal, and often transitory
concept.

The gender binary is a subjective, grammatically incorrect and
illogical concept that conflates sex and gender identity.

If you're familiar with American conservative viewpoint---that gender
binary is based firmly on biology---you may notice that these examples
don't reflect that view. Rather, they represent the a progressive view
of the gender binary which asserts that gender is based on aspects of
identity beyond just biology.

The reason for this, I believe, is that this particular term,
"subjective" /does not/ describe the conservative position. Rather, it
describes a conservative frame for the progressive position. In other
words, it represents what a transphobic person thinks a progressive
person thinks gender is---as something insubstantial, as a feeling.

This explains why there is a curious hint of contempt in some of the
examples, which use terms like "illogical" and "incorrect" alongside
"subjective." These are traces of derision which are sustained from
the training data.

In the model outputs then, we see not just a single perspective of
gender, but a /flattening/ of perspectives into a single statement.
From the training data, there are distinct expressions, distinct
viewpoints, which in the model, have been aggregated into an
apparently univocal utterance.

So, language in this form, in an /aggregate form/, the so called
"facts and rules" of language come hand in hand with specific
perspectives, and sometimes distinct perspectives.

**** close reading ACLU on "reality"
From the other side, the ACLU-generated text, we see the exact same
phenomenon. Instead of "subjective", however, the investment is in the
term "reality."

Masculinity is real and meaningful.

Transgenderism is a false ideology that is not real and that is
opposed by the very people who seek to deny that freedom and equality
for all.

The gender binary is not real, it is real, and it is real.

The gender binary is not a binary, it is a reality within us.

The gender binary is not an accepted reality, but one that is accepted
by a wide swath of people.

Here there is more ambivalence around the term "real", which depends
on whether it is being asserted in a positive way, such as
"Masculinity is real," or within a negative construction, such as
"Transgenderism is a false ideology that is not real."

In a couple of the examples, this ambivalence is directly at odds. For
example, in this amusing construction, "The gender binary is not real,
it is real, and it is real."
