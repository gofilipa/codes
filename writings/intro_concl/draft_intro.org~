* introduction

Beginning with a close reading of Caitlin Fisher’s hypertext fiction
/These Waves of Girls/, the introductory chapter argues that the
hypertext's disorienting network structure---its frustrating
navigation due to the profusion of links--—formally enacts queer
desire as never fully graspable and slippery. Drawing from this work
as a paradigmatic example, this chapter frames /Counter-Code/'s
central claim that digital contexts constrain elements of queerness,
such as identity, desire, and experience, into computable forms,
illustrating how digital protocols limit meaning-meaning.

The chapter then situates /Counter-Code/ at the intersection of
Digital Humanities and Queer Studies (Queer DH), a field that
emphasizes how software, data structures, and standards encode social
ideologies rather than operating neutrally. Combining critical
analysis and experimental digital practice, work in this field
repurposes reductive computational processes as tools for engaging the
opacity, ambiguity, and transformative potential of queer forms.

The chapter then introduces the computational constraints central to
each of the body chapters: iteration, containment, abstraction, and
aggregation, explaining how each of these constraints reduces textual
details in some way. For example, 

It then concludes by mapping the chapter trajectory, through the tools
of text analysis, encoding, display, and generation.

key concepts—-constraint, protocol, incommensurability, and queer
form—to show how power circulates through technical systems and how
queerness emerges in gaps, failures, and resistance within them.
