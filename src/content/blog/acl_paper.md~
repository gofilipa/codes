* Revising Butler

I recently submitted the paper, which I have been working on since
January, to the Association for Computational Linguistics conference
(ACL).

I am way out of my depth.

Every keystroke you spend on someone else is a keystroke that you
don't write for yourself.

Am I cringe?

Revising my thinking on the binary.

Every keystroke.

I wrote this paper about

"Just because we emerge from a binary system doesn't mean we need to
be fully determined by it."

Over the past few months, I have been revising my [paper on
binaries](), to submit to the ACL (Association for Computational
Linguistics).

The paper is about binaries, and how a form of what I call "binary
thinking" pervades research about gender bias in NLP. The idea is that
the binary model goes beyond the realm of gender (beyond male/female,
in other words) and into a form of thinking that reduces and
simplifies the ways we conceptualize gender bias. This form of
thinking inspires what I call two "myths" about bias: that bias is
categorical, and that bias is zero-sum. These myths attempt to
shepherd bias into schemas that fundamentally misunderstand the way
that bias works. The effect is that techniques for studying and
mitigating gender bias often miss the mark.  

A more effective approach, I believe, will be to study gender as a
physical phenomenon. To that end, I am considering compiling a dataset
that labels gender terms by the way that they manifest in behavior and
expression. Here I'm following an argument from Kadj Amin's essay,
"[We are all nonbinary]()" about conceptualizing gender in ways that
make visible those who are most marginalized by gender norms. Amin
suggests that gender be conceptualized through physical aspects, such
as behavior and expression, rather than through identification, which
is internal. The idea is that marking gender as an external,
outward-facing phenomenon will make visible those who occupy
historically marginal gender expressions, especially those that are
feminized (Amin offers the example of the "queen").
